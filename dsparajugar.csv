However, theoretical and applied research on stochastic motion in the field of robotics and mechanisms face many challenges due to the uncertainty of stochastic motion. Currently, a large gap remains in the research of stochastic motion mechanism. In this study, a novel mechanism that can conduct probabilistic rolling is proposed to reach a designated position and achieve overlying movement over a particular area. The mechanism consists of a regular tetrahedron frame, a central node, and four connecting linear actuators. According to mobility and kinematic analyses, the mechanism can implement probabilistic rolling. Each rolling gait has three probable rolling directions, and the mechanism rolls in one of the three directions in probability. A kinematic simulation is conducted, and a control method is proposed on the basis of the moving path analysis. Furthermore, the mathematical principle of probabilistic rolling is revealed in terms of probability theory and statistics. Lastly, a prototype is fabricated. To achieve the rolling function, the design of the linear actuators is improved, and the extension ratio is increased from 0.58 to 1.13. Then, tests are conducted.

As a result, content caching is gradually extending to network edges to provide low-latency services, improve quality of service, and reduce redundant data traffic. Compared to the conventional content delivery networks, caches in edge networks with smaller sizes usually have to accommodate more bursty requests. In this article, we propose an evolving learning-based content caching policy, named PA-Cache in edge networks. It adaptively learns time-varying content popularity and determines which contents should be replaced when the cache is full. Unlike conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), which learn a fine-tuned but possibly outdated or biased prediction model using the entire training dataset with high computational complexity, PA-Cache weighs a large set of content features and trains the multi-layer recurrent neural network from shallow to deeper when more requests arrive over time. We extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed PA-Cache on real-world traces from a large online video-on-demand service provider. The results show that PA-Cache outperforms existing popular caching algorithms and approximates the optimal algorithm with only a 3.8% performance gap when the cache percentage is 1.0%.

Computer- and robotic-assisted technologies have recently been introduced into orthopedic surgery to improve accuracy. Each requires intraoperative “bone registration,” but existing methods are time consuming, often inaccurate, and/or require bulky and costly equipment that produces substantial radiation.

Methods

We developed a novel method of bone registration using a compact 3D structured light surface scanner that can scan thousands of points simultaneously without any ionizing radiation.

Visible light is projected in a specific pattern onto a 3 × 3 cm2 area of exposed bone, which deforms the pattern in a way determined by the local bone geometry. A quantitative analysis reconstructs this local geometry and compares it to the preoperative imaging, thereby effecting rapid bone registration.

A registration accuracy study using our novel method was conducted on 24 CT-scanned femur Sawbones®. We simulated exposures typically seen during knee/hip arthroplasty and common bone tumor resections. The registration accuracy of our technique was quantified by measuring the discrepancy of known points (i.e., pre-drilled holes) on the bone.

Results

Our technique demonstrated a registration accuracy of 0.44 ± 0.22 mm. This compared favorably with literature-reported values of 0.68 ± 0.14 mm (p-value = 0.001) for the paired-point technique13 and 0.86 ± 0.38 mm for the intraoperative CT based techniques 14 (not enough reported data to calculate p-value).

Conclusion

We have developed a novel method of bone registration for computer and robotic-assisted surgery using 3D surface scanning technology that is rapid, compact, and radiation-free. We have demonstrated increased accuracy compared to existing methods (using historical controls).",0

This technology represents an opportunity for specialized education where virtual commissioning could be used to equip control and automation laboratories in which students and trainees in automation can test, validate, and debug their control and automation strategies.

The experts performed three types of range-of-motion exercises: (i) elevation–depression of sterno-clavicular joint; (ii) extension and flexion of glenohumeral joint; (iii) lateral and medial rotation of glenohumeral joint. The experimental results showed that the quantitative results for all the exercises were significantly different between the experts. Moreover, we observed that even experienced professionals need consistent care education based on quantitative data and feedback. Thus, we confirmed the necessity and feasibility of the care training assistant robot for improving the skills required for elderly care.",0

In recent years, the need for piping inspection has been increasing, and various in-pipe inspection robots have been studied and developed by several research and educational institutes and companies so far. However, there are few verification examples of moving mechanisms considering the run-through performance of pipe fitting (bent pipes and branch pipes).

We have proposed an omnidirectional mobile mechanism for pipe-inspection robot in small diameter pipes. A movement control method in the pipe by omnidirectional movement mechanism equipped with four independent rotary wheels has been discussed. It was shown that the approach of movement control of vehicles was applicable. The straight, spiral and rotary movements can be confirmed by modeling of the omnidirectional mechanism and simulation using proposed method.",0

For each exercise, a software template has been developed, performing all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student’s code. Using this template, the student just focuses on the robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details which have little educational value. The templates are coded as ROS nodes or as Jupyter Notebooks ready to use in the web browser. Reference solutions for illustrative purposes and automatic assessment tools for gamification have also been developed. An introductory course to intelligent robotics has been elaborated and its contents are available and ready to use at Robotics-Academy, including reactive behaviors, path planning, local/global navigation, and self-localization algorithms. Robotics-Academy provides a valuable complement to master classes in blended learning, massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online video courses, devoted to addressing theoretical content.

Over the past 200 years, popular culture has considered the imaginary consequences of the danger to humanity and human-ness of replicating the autonomous human form too faithfully. Today, the seductive allure of technologically advanced simulated human bodies and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence has brought us closer to facing this possibility. Alongside the simultaneous aversion and fascination of the possibility that autonomous simulated human forms may become indistinguishable from human beings is the deep-rooted uncanniness of the automaton in its strange familiarity – not only to ourselves but to our pleasant childhood imaginings of playing with dolls. As such, simulated human bodies are often enrolled in medical and nursing education models with the assumption that making the simulation teaching spaces seem as close to clinical spaces as possible will allow students to practise potentially harmful clinical skills without causing any harm to human patients. However similar the simulated human bodies may appear to a living, breathing human, a tension between the embodiment of particularly human attributes and their replication persists. How can computerized human patient simulators be enrolled to teach people to develop the necessary attributes of compassion and empathy when caring for human beings? This article explores the uncanny ecologies of simulated human patients in nursing education by presenting a posthuman analysis of the practices of nurse educators as they enrol these digital objects in their teaching. Guided by a selection of heuristics offered as a mode of interviewing digital objects, the analysis enrolled ‘Gathering Anecdotes’ and ‘Unravelling Translations’ to attune to the ways in which these uncanny posthuman assemblages become powerful modes of knowing to mobilize learning about human attributes within uncanny posthuman ecologies.",0

Surgical cricothyroidotomy is an essential skill for immediate airway management in trauma. Training for surgical cricothyroidotomy has been undertaken using simulators, cadavers or animal models. The ideal approach to training for this low volume and high-risk procedure is unknown. We hypothesized that current simulation technology provides an equal or better education for surgical cricothyroidotomy when compared with animal tissue training.

Methods We performed a prospective randomized controlled study comparing training for surgical cricothyroidotomy using hands-on training on swine versus inanimate manikin. We enrolled medical students who had never performed or had formal instruction on surgical cricothyroidotomy. We randomized their instruction to use either a swine model or the inanimate version of the Operative Experience Inc. advanced surgical manikin. Participants’ skills were then evaluated on human cadavers and on an advanced robotic manikin. Tests were scored using checklists modified from Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills and Tactical Combat Casualty Care. We compared scores between the groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and generalized linear models.

Results Forty-eight participants were enrolled and trained; 30 participants completed the first testing session; 25 completed the second testing session. The mean time to establish an airway from the incision until the cuff was blown up was 95±52 s. There were no significant differences in any of the outcome measures between the two training groups.

Discussion Measured performance was not different between subjects trained to perform surgical cricothyroidotomy on an animal model or a high fidelity manikin. The use of an advanced simulator has the potential to replace live tissue for this procedure mitigating concerns over animal rights.

Using this methodology, we present the formative evaluation of a VR simulation designed for training troubleshooting skills during robotic surgeries. The results of our formative evaluation clearly demonstrated usability issues for some of our targeted training subtasks and we discuss how those issues will be addressed.",0

Recently, cyber physical systems have provided a promising solution for the requirements mentioned above. Despite recent progress, some critical issues have not been fully addressed at the shop floor level, including dynamic reorganization and reconfiguration, ubiquitous networking, and time constrained computing. Toward the next generation production system for industrial robots, this study proposed a hybrid architecture for smart assembly shop floors with closed-loop dynamic cyber physical interactions. Aiming for dynamic reorganization and reconfiguration, the study also proposed modularized smart assembly units for the deployment of physical assembly processes. Enabling technologies, such as multiagent system (MAS), self-organized wireless sensor actuator networks, and edge computing, were discussed and then integrated into the proposed architecture. Furthermore, a multijoint robot assembly process was selected as a target scenario. Thus, an MAS was developed to simulate the coordination and negotiation mechanisms for the proposed architecture on the basis of the Java Agent Development Framework platform.",0

To study this feature in quadruped locomotion, we propose here a new open-source, small-sized reconfigurable quadruped robot, called Lilibot, with multiple sensory feedback and its physical simulation. Lilibot was designed as a friendly quadrupedal platform with unique characteristics, including light weight, easy handling, modular components, and multiple real-time sensory feedback. Its modular components can be flexibly reconfigured to obtain features, such as different leg orientations for testing the effectiveness and generalization of self-organized locomotion control. Its multiple sensory feedback (i.e., joint angles, joint velocities, joint currents, joint voltages, and body inclination) can support vestibular reflexes and compliant control mechanisms for body posture stabilization and compliant behavior, respectively. To evaluate the performance of Lilibot, we implemented our developed adaptive neural controller on it. The experimental results demonstrated that Lilibot can autonomously and rapidly exhibit adaptive and versatile behaviors, including spontaneous self-organized locomotion (i.e., adaptive locomotion) under different leg orientations, body posture stabilization on a tiltable plane, and leg compliance for unexpected external load compensation. To this end, we successfully developed an open-source, friendly, small-sized, and lightweight quadruped robot with reconfigurable legs and multiple sensory feedback that can serve as a generic quadrupedal platform for research and education in the fields of locomotion, vestibular reflex-based, and compliant control.",0

Thus, the level of discombobulation among people, companies, or countries is indeed unprecedented. The fact that industry 4.0 is explosively disrupting or retrofitting each and every industrial sector makes industry 4.0 the famous buzzword amongst researchers today. However, the insight of industry 4.0 disruption into the industrial sectors remains ill-defined in both academic and nonacademic literature. The present study aimed at identifying industry 4.0 neologisms, understanding the industry 4.0 disruption and illustrating the disruptive technology convergence in the major industrial sectors.

This type of curriculum has heavy emphasis on theory and less on exploration, application and design. In this model, opportunities for students to do hands-on activities such as building hardware and deal with troubleshooting, writing simulation models and learning by failing, etc. are quite limited. Also, many instructors in these systems are uncomfortable to adopt more hands-on teaching for the fear of failure. In 2019, in China, I taught a freshmen-level course on Introduction to Robotics using Arduino-based hardware where the students had to work in teams to build and program a mobile robot using parts that were provided to them. In 2020, I taught two classes in India for junior/senior level students on Modeling and Simulation of Mechatronic Systems and Modeling and Simulation of Hybrid Vehicles, respectively. In both courses the students spent over 80% of class time developing models and running simulations. In all three courses, enrolling about 60 students each, extensive survey-based assessment showed students are hungry for this type of hands-on experience and would be embracing these types of classes with a lot of enthusiasm.

As being one of the pillars of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, DT-s are widely integrated into the existing factories, enhancing the concept of the virtual factories. View from the research perspective is that experiments on the Internet of Things, data acquisition, cybersecurity, telemetry synchronization with physical factories, etc. are being executed in those virtual simulations. Moreover, new ways of interactions and interface to oversee, interact and learn are being developed via the assistance of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, which are already widely spread on the consumer market. However, already, VR is being used widely in existing commercial software packages and toolboxes to provide students, teachers, operators, engineers, production managers, and researchers with an immersive way of interacting with the factory while the manufacturing simulation is running. This gives a better understanding and more in-depth knowledge of the actual manufacturing processes, not being directly accessing those. However, the virtual presence mentioned above experience is limited to a single person. It does not enable additional functionalities for the simulations, which can be re-planning or even re-programming of the physical factory in an online connection by using VR or AR interfaces. The main aim of the related research paper is to enhance already existing fully synchronized with physical world DT-s with multi-user experience, enabling factory operators to work with and re-program the real machinery from remote locations in a more intuitive way instead thinking about final aim than about the process itself. Moreover, being developed using real-time platform Unity3D, this multiplayer solution gives opportunities for training and educational purposes and is connecting people from remote locations of the world. Use-cases exploits industrial robots placed in the Industrial Virtual and Augmented Reality Laboratory environment of Tallinn University of Technology and a mobile robot solution developed based on a collaboration between the University of Southern Denmark and a Danish company. Experiments are being performed on the connection between Estonia and Denmark while performing reprogramming tasks of the physical heavy industrial robots.

We then demonstrate the application of the framework by exploring how the computational thinking of two fifth grade learners emerged as an embodied phenomenon during an educational robotics activity. The findings suggest that, for young children, computational thinking was extended to include the structures in the environment and guided by their embodiment of mathematical concepts. Specifically, the participants repeatedly used their bodies to simulate different possibilities for action while incorporating both perceptual and formal multiplicative reasoning strategies to conceptualize the robot’s movements.
