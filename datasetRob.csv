We extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed PA-Cache on real-world traces from a large online video-on-demand service provider.

Computer- and robotic-assisted technologies have recently been introduced into orthopedic surgery to improve accuracy. Each requires intraoperative “bone registration,” but existing methods are time consuming, often inaccurate, and/or require bulky and costly equipment that produces substantial radiation.

Methods

We developed a novel method of bone registration using a compact 3D structured light surface scanner that can scan thousands of points simultaneously without any ionizing radiation.

Visible light is projected in a specific pattern onto a 3 × 3 cm2 area of exposed bone, which deforms the pattern in a way determined by the local bone geometry. A quantitative analysis reconstructs this local geometry and compares it to the preoperative imaging, thereby effecting rapid bone registration.

A registration accuracy study using our novel method was conducted on 24 CT-scanned femur Sawbones®. We simulated exposures typically seen during knee/hip arthroplasty and common bone tumor resections. The registration accuracy of our technique was quantified by measuring the discrepancy of known points (i.e., pre-drilled holes) on the bone.

Results

Our technique demonstrated a registration accuracy of 0.44 ± 0.22 mm. This compared favorably with literature-reported values of 0.68 ± 0.14 mm (p-value = 0.001) for the paired-point technique13 and 0.86 ± 0.38 mm for the intraoperative CT based techniques 14 (not enough reported data to calculate p-value).

Conclusion

We have developed a novel method of bone registration for computer and robotic-assisted surgery using 3D surface scanning technology that is rapid, compact, and radiation-free. We have demonstrated increased accuracy compared to existing methods (using historical controls).",NO,30

We performed a research intervention including facilitation, observation and video- recordings of three play sessions organized in March-May 2020. The preliminary findings indicate how guided playing with the robot dog supported SEL through conversation about human relationships, while interaction with the real dog facilitated empathic responses through spontaneous reactions on the animal's behavior.

For each exercise, a software template has been developed, performing all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student’s code. Using this template, the student just focuses on the robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details which have little educational value. The templates are coded as ROS nodes or as Jupyter Notebooks ready to use in the web browser. Reference solutions for illustrative purposes and automatic assessment tools for gamification have also been developed. An introductory course to intelligent robotics has been elaborated and its contents are available and ready to use at Robotics-Academy, including reactive behaviors, path planning, local/global navigation, and self-localization algorithms. Robotics-Academy provides a valuable complement to master classes in blended learning, massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online video courses, devoted to addressing theoretical content.

Over the past 200 years, popular culture has considered the imaginary consequences of the danger to humanity and human-ness of replicating the autonomous human form too faithfully. Today, the seductive allure of technologically advanced simulated human bodies and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence has brought us closer to facing this possibility. Alongside the simultaneous aversion and fascination of the possibility that autonomous simulated human forms may become indistinguishable from human beings is the deep-rooted uncanniness of the automaton in its strange familiarity – not only to ourselves but to our pleasant childhood imaginings of playing with dolls. As such, simulated human bodies are often enrolled in medical and nursing education models with the assumption that making the simulation teaching spaces seem as close to clinical spaces as possible will allow students to practise potentially harmful clinical skills without causing any harm to human patients. However similar the simulated human bodies may appear to a living, breathing human, a tension between the embodiment of particularly human attributes and their replication persists. How can computerized human patient simulators be enrolled to teach people to develop the necessary attributes of compassion and empathy when caring for human beings?

Surgical cricothyroidotomy is an essential skill for immediate airway management in trauma. Training for surgical cricothyroidotomy has been undertaken using simulators, cadavers or animal models. The ideal approach to training for this low volume and high-risk procedure is unknown. We hypothesized that current simulation technology provides an equal or better education for surgical cricothyroidotomy when compared with animal tissue training.

Methods We performed a prospective randomized controlled study comparing training for surgical cricothyroidotomy using hands-on training on swine versus inanimate manikin. We enrolled medical students who had never performed or had formal instruction on surgical cricothyroidotomy. We randomized their instruction to use either a swine model or the inanimate version of the Operative Experience Inc. advanced surgical manikin. Participants’ skills were then evaluated on human cadavers and on an advanced robotic manikin. Tests were scored using checklists modified from Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills and Tactical Combat Casualty Care. We compared scores between the groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and generalized linear models.

Results Forty-eight participants were enrolled and trained; 30 participants completed the first testing session; 25 completed the second testing session. The mean time to establish an airway from the incision until the cuff was blown up was 95±52 s. There were no significant differences in any of the outcome measures between the two training groups.

Discussion Measured performance was not different between subjects trained to perform surgical cricothyroidotomy on an animal model or a high fidelity manikin. The use of an advanced simulator has the potential to replace live tissue for this procedure mitigating concerns over animal rights.

We examined existing published literature on how 3D printing technologies have been utilized in the field of Urology to enhance pre-operative planning, revitalize surgical training, and modernize patient education, with particular focus on, robotic surgery. To date, 3D-printed models have been used and studied most commonly in the preoperative planning for nephron-sparing surgeries during the treatment of renal masses, where the challenges of complex renal anatomy and benefits of reducing renal ischemic injury create the most intuitive value. Prostate models are the second most common, particularly in the planning of nerve-sparing procedures. Early studies have demonstrated sufficient realism and educational effectiveness.

The results of our formative evaluation clearly demonstrated usability issues for some of our targeted training subtasks and we discuss how those issues will be addressed.",NO,30

Toward the next generation production system for industrial robots, this study proposed a hybrid architecture for smart assembly shop floors with closed-loop dynamic cyber physical interactions. Aiming for dynamic reorganization and reconfiguration, the study also proposed modularized smart assembly units for the deployment of physical assembly processes. Enabling technologies, such as multiagent system (MAS), self-organized wireless sensor actuator networks, and edge computing, were discussed and then integrated into the proposed architecture. Furthermore, a multijoint robot assembly process was selected as a target scenario.

To study this feature in quadruped locomotion, we propose here a new open-source, small-sized reconfigurable quadruped robot, called Lilibot, with multiple sensory feedback and its physical simulation. Lilibot was designed as a friendly quadrupedal platform with unique characteristics, including light weight, easy handling, modular components, and multiple real-time sensory feedback. Its modular components can be flexibly reconfigured to obtain features, such as different leg orientations for testing the effectiveness and generalization of self-organized locomotion control. Its multiple sensory feedback (i.e., joint angles, joint velocities, joint currents, joint voltages, and body inclination) can support vestibular reflexes and compliant control mechanisms for body posture stabilization and compliant behavior, respectively. To evaluate the performance of Lilibot, we implemented our developed adaptive neural controller on it. The experimental results demonstrated that Lilibot can autonomously and rapidly exhibit adaptive and versatile behaviors, including spontaneous self-organized locomotion (i.e., adaptive locomotion) under different leg orientations, body posture stabilization on a tiltable plane, and leg compliance for unexpected external load compensation. To this end, we successfully developed an open-source, friendly, small-sized, and lightweight quadruped robot with reconfigurable legs and multiple sensory feedback that can serve as a generic quadrupedal platform for research and education in the fields of locomotion, vestibular reflex-based, and compliant control.",NO,30

View from the research perspective is that experiments on the Internet of Things, data acquisition, cybersecurity, telemetry synchronization with physical factories, etc. are being executed in those virtual simulations. Moreover, new ways of interactions and interface to oversee, interact and learn are being developed via the assistance of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, which are already widely spread on the consumer market. However, already, VR is being used widely in existing commercial software packages and toolboxes to provide students, teachers, operators, engineers, production managers, and researchers with an immersive way of interacting with the factory while the manufacturing simulation is running. This gives a better understanding and more in-depth knowledge of the actual manufacturing processes, not being directly accessing those.

Objective
In this review, we aim to present the impact of 3D printing, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) techniques for prostate cancer procedures, specifically prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP).
Evidence acquisition
A systematic review was performed by two investigators according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria.
Evidence synthesis
A total of 541 papers were identified in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Of these, 53 studies were identified for detailed review and 25 were qualified. Two more studies were identified from the references; thus, 27 studies were finally included in this systematic review. Nine papers reported on the use of 3D reconstructed models, mainly in education/training and intraoperative guidance; nine reported on VR, focusing on simulation training model and intraoperative guidance; and nine reported on AR technique with its best indication for surgical guidance in robotic RP.
Conclusions
Three-dimensional visualization techniques have gradually been introduced and developed in prostate procedures, and demonstrate potential utility not only for education/training, but also for surgical planning and intraoperative guidance. Prospective studies are needed to demonstrate clinical utility and validation of these technologies.

With the Advanced Robotics Analysis Toolbox (ARAT), kinematic and dynamic modeling and analysis of the complex, high DOF, serial robots which may have universal, spherical, prismatic, or rotational joints with more than one DOF and a mobile or stationary base can be easily accomplished. The ARAT was used to design and analyze different complex structures of serial robots for robotic education students and robotics researchers who design and build exceptional new robots. The robot's kinematic and dynamic parameters including link lengths, directions, masses and inertias can be entered into the ARAT using a user-friendly interface. Solid models of the robots can be created in a three dimensional (3D) environment for virtual reality simulations. In the ARAT, forward and inverse kinematic models, Jacobian matrix, trajectory planning, forward and inverse dynamic models can be produced in a computationally efficient way. All of the physical robot parameters such as angular and linear velocities, accelerations, forces, and torques at the joints, link origins and the center of mass of the links can be computed in 3D.

In this study, we model SNSs in a classroom and apply multi-agent simulation to analyze the influence of SNSs on classroom friendships. We focus on junior high school students as our research object.

One way to address this problem is through better education and training, of which computational tools may prove invaluable. Thus, in this paper, we explore how to build systems that can recognize and synthesize asymmetrical facial expressions. We introduce a novel computational model of asymmetric facial expressions for BP, which we can synthesize on either virtual and robotic patient simulators.

As a result, science educators are faced with the challenge of helping students view technological instruments not as transparent and neutral devices that simply “depict reality” (naïve instrumentalism) and reveal what is “really” there (naïve realism), but as powerful epistemic tools that help co-constitute the reality being investigated, often (re)shaping what counts as “real” in revolutionary ways.

•

Conditional and contingency sequencing enhances the science return of rover missions.
The return of samples from known locations on Mars is among the highest priority goals of the international planetary science community. A possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3 missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team, and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis.

CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015 operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as inverted paleochannels.

Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12–21), were conducted with the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020 rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22–39) was implemented without the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the Science Team prioritized 3 for “return to Earth”. Various science autonomy capabilities, based on flight-proven or near-future techniques intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016 CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and conditional sequencing were also employed.

Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made. Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region, collected out-of-simulation, have been analysed using a range of laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering large suites of geological and geochemical survey data.

Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook), articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016 activities had 90% of participants “somewhat agreeing” or “strongly agreeing” that participation in the mission has helped them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.",NO,30

Such noise would degrade the quality of the acquired infrared spectrum, limiting the precision of the subsequent processing. In this paper, we present a novel blind reconstruction method with wavelet transform regularizations for infrared spectrum obtained from the aging instrument. Inspired by the finding that the wavelet coefficient distribution of the clean spectrum is sparser than that of the degraded spectrum, a blind reconstruction model for infrared spectrum is proposed in this paper to regularize the distribution of the degraded spectrum by total variation regularization. This method outperforms when suppressing random noise and preserving the spectral structure details. In addition, an effective optimization scheme is introduced in overcoming the issue of formulated optimization. The instrument response function and latent spectrum can be simultaneously estimated through the proposed method that can efficiently mitigate the effects caused by instrument degradation. Finally, extensive experiments on simulated and real noisy infrared spectra are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art ones.

All RoboCup leagues contribute to this goal, for example the Simulation Leagues with research on strategic game play, the Standard Platform League with stable walking and vision algorithms and the Humanoid League with mechatronics of bipedal robots. However, especially in the Humanoid League, the swift improvement in performance of the robots makes it significantly harder for newcomers to enter into this field of research. With robots increasing in size, with new challenges in mechatronics for bipedal robots and software increasing in complexity, the gap for new teams is widening on the course to the 2050 game. There have been many approaches to easy entry, such as the introduction of a two-league system in the Standard Platform (SPL) and Small Size League (SSL) or an ‘educational challenge’ at regional @home events. While the SPL and SSL approaches require fully developed hard- and software in order to compete, as the @home challenge, we propose an entry-level league with a reduced set of requirements to bridge the gap between the Junior level and advanced Humanoid League. We believe that the Humanoid League can only reach the 2050 goal if new researchers and universities can be attracted on a regular basis. Attracting new researchers requires an easy entry path for new teams, suitable for undergraduate students and universities with a limited budget.

In terms of physical and chemical properties, such as density, thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, their huge differences between the two fluidic phases remain a big challenge for analyzing the hybrid flow behaviors. Besides, the liquid metal immersed in the solution can move and deform when administrated with non-contact electromagnetic force, or even induced by redox reaction, which is entirely different from the cases of conventional contact force. Owing to its remarkable capability in flow and deformation, liquid metal immersed in the solution is apt to deform on an extremely large scale, resulting in marked changes on its boundary and interface. However, the working mechanisms of the movement and deformation of liquid metal lack appropriate models to describe such scientific issues via a set of well-established unified equations. To promote investigations in this important area, the present paper is dedicated to summarizing this unconventional hydrodynamics from experiment, theory, and simulation. Typical experimental phenomena and basic working mechanisms are illustrated, followed by the movement and deformation theories to explain these phenomena.

Nao delivered the performance as either an independent storyteller, or as a collaborator with a human storyteller. We assessed the effectiveness of HRC by comparing the participants' preference over the two settings. We found that 1) most participants believe that HRC is effective and prefer HRC over the robot-only performance; and 2) the complementarily effective roles of human and robot storytellers in interacting with the participants provide a glimpse of evidence on the preference towards HRC.

Many solutions with a focus on the results rather than the details of the interactions between the objects in the real and virtual worlds have been developed. Therefore, the real procedures are distorted and the users lose their perception of in-person participation.

In order to improve the users’ feel of immersion further and to simulate more realistic operations in VR, a procedure-oriented approach for the combination of real and virtual environments is proposed here. As its name implies, this approach emphasizes the details of the procedures, namely how to capture, track, operate and interoperate the real and virtual objects in a mixed environment. In order to illustrate this idea, a prototype of mixed real and virtual assembly, in con-junction with object recognition and rigid-object tracking functions based on robotic vision techniques, is presented as an example. This prototype is designed based on a game-based virtual laoratory system, and the specific implementation is a planetary gear train experiment. In this experiment, all models of the parts with the information required for the assembly are created, labeled and added to the database of the virtual laboratory system. The physical parts are marked in order to facilitate object recognition and object tracking. During the experiment, the main assembly with one missing planetary gear is accomplished in a purely virtual environment. In the real world, the missing planetary gear is tracked by a Kinect while the user is manipulating this gear. Then, the system recognizes this gear based on the markers and couples the corresponding virtual model of that gear with the avatar’s hand in the virtual environment. Afterward, the cam-era tracks the real part, and the user can adjust its pose and location to finish the final assembly. The main benefit of this implementation is that the user can take advantage of some simple real parts in conjunction with virtual models of sophisticated parts in order to get realistic experience with the assembly process.",,30

However, despite the multiple features offered by neural modelling tools, their integration with environments for the simulation of robots and agents can be challenging and time consuming. The implementation of artificial neural circuits to control robots generally involves the following tasks: (1) understanding the simulation tools, (2) creating the neural circuit in the neural simulator, (3) linking the simulated neural circuit with the environment of the agent and (4) programming the appropriate interface in the robot or agent to use the neural controller. The accomplishment of the above-mentioned tasks can be challenging, especially for undergraduate students or novice researchers. This paper presents an alternative tool which facilitates the simulation of simple SNN circuits using the multi-agent simulation and the programming environment Netlogo (educational software that simplifies the study and experimentation of complex systems). The engine proposed and implemented in Netlogo for the simulation of a functional model of SNN is a simplification of integrate and fire (I&F) models. The characteristics of the engine (including neuronal dynamics, STDP learning and synaptic delay) are demonstrated through the implementation of an agent representing an artificial insect controlled by a simple neural circuit.

It is critical, therefore, that educational institutions adequately respond to this high demand for robotics specialists by developing and offering appropriate courses geared towards professional certification in robotics and automation. In order to effectively teach concepts of industrial robotics, the curriculum needs to be supported by the hands on activities utilizing industrial robots or providing training on robotic simulation software.

•

Two-state and three-state Markov chain models are employed in this study.

•

They show that external factors can be used to control the rate of computerization.

•

Factors include government-led, educational initiatives and work incentives.

•

Such factors can be manipulated to counter unregulated technological progress.

•

Revised education will prepare the transition into a computer-driven world.
Recent technological advances in big data, machine learning, and robotics, have begun to have a negative influence on existing employment opportunities for human beings. Numerous studies have demonstrated a worrisome decline in low- and medium-income employment resulting from the replacement of human workforce with machines. A seminal study by Frey and Osborne in 2013 predicted that 47% of the 702 examined occupations in the United States faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 10–25 years as a result of computerization. Despite the seemingly dystopian future foreshadowed by these numbers, the wholesale replacement of labor by machines will most likely not become a reality in the foreseeable future for an array of reasons, including the creativity required by many occupations and interventions by governments.

However, despite the barriers, computerization is likely to have a significant effect on the current market. In this paper, we aim to track the relative quantities of jobs that are either susceptible or non-susceptible to computerization in the future, by developing and utilizing an analytical model using Markov chains. Various simulations performed using this model demonstrate the importance of intervention policies, such as improved technical education of the public, in controlling the rate of computerization. Moreover, the simulations identify the probable creation of new jobs that would facilitate new human employment. Although radical changes in technology and economy await humanity, adequate preparation will help to facilitate a smoother transition into the age of computers.",,30

To answer this challenge, we propose a connected environment which integrates the robot, its digital twin and virtual sensors. We implemented a reinforcement learning scenario in which a humanoid robot learns to lift a weight of unknown mass through autonomous trial-and-error search. To expedite the process, trials of the physical robot are substituted by simulations with its digital twin. The optimal parameters of the robot posture for executing the weightlifting task, found by analysis of the virtual trials, are transmitted to the robot through internet communication. The approach exposes students to the concepts and technologies of machine learning, parametric design, digital prototyping and simulation, connectivity and internet of things.

Remote sensing and data fusion historically have been the purview of large government organizations, such as the Department of Defense (DoD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) due to the high cost and complexity of developing, fielding, and operating such systems. However, miniaturized computers with high capacity processing capabilities, small and affordable sensors, and emerging, commercially available platforms such as UAS and CubeSats to carry such sensors, have allowed for a vast range of novel applications. In order to leverage these developments, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) has developed an advanced sensor and data fusion laboratory to research component capabilities and their employment on a wide-range of autonomous, robotic, and transportation systems. This lab is unique in several ways, for example, it provides a traditional campus laboratory for students and faculty to model and test sensors in a range of scenarios, process multi-sensor data sets (both simulated and experimental), and analyze results. Moreover, such allows for “virtual” modeling, testing, and teaching capability reaching beyond the physical confines of the facility for use among ERAU Worldwide students and faculty located around the globe. Although other institutions such as Georgia Institute of Technology, Lockheed Martin, University of Dayton, and University of Central Florida have optical sensor laboratories, the ERAU virtual concept is the first such lab to expand to multispectral sensors and data fusion, while focusing on the data collection and data products and not on the manufacturing aspect. Further, the initiative is a unique effort among Embry-Riddle faculty to develop multi-disciplinary, cross-campus research to facilitate faculty- and student-driven research. Specifically, the ERAU Worldwide Campus, with locations across the globe and delivering curricula online, will be leveraged to provide novel approaches to remote sensor experimentation and simulation.

Even when such advanced technologies are utilised, they fail to construct a meaningful view of the hidden worlds that relate to the learning context, leaving learners with formidable challenges to understanding the operation of these deep technologies. Therefore, a pedagogical virtual machine (PVM) model was employed to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the proposed model.

The following paper is a “Q&A interview” conducted by Joanne Pransky of Industrial Robot journal as a method to impart the combined technological, business and personal experience of a prominent, robotic industry engineer-turned successful innovator and leader, regarding the challenges of bringing technological discoveries to fruition. The paper aims to discuss these issues.

Design/methodology/approach

The interviewee is Gianmarco Veruggio who is responsible for the Operational Unit of Genoa of the Italian National Research Council Institute of Electronics, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering (CNR-IEIIT). Veruggio is an early pioneer of telerobotics in extreme environments. Veruggio founded the new applicative field of Roboethics. In this interview, Veruggio shares some of his 30-year robotic journey along with his thoughts and concerns on robotics and society.

Findings

Gianmarco Veruggio received a master’s degree in electronic engineering, computer science, control and automation from Genoa University in 1980. From 1980 to 1983 he worked in the Automation Division of Ansaldo as a Designer of fault-tolerant multiprocessor architectures for fail-safe control systems and was part of the development team for the new automation of the Italian Railway Stations. In 1984, he joined the CNR-Institute of Naval Automation (IAN) in Genoa as a Research Scientist. There, he worked on real-time computer graphics for simulation, control techniques and naval and marine data-collection systems. In 1989, he founded the CNR-IAN Robotics Department (Robotlab), which he headed until 2003, to develop missions on experimental robotics in extreme environments. His approach utilized working prototypes in a virtual lab environment and focused on robot mission control, real-time human-machine interfaces, networked control system architectures for tele-robotics and Internet Robotics. In 2000, he founded the association “Scuola di Robotica” (School of Robotics) to promote this new science among young people and society at large by means of educational robotics. He joined the CNR-IEIIT in 2007 to continue his research in robotics and to also develop studies on the philosophical, social and ethical implications of Robotics.

Originality/value

Veruggio led the first Italian underwater robotics campaigns in Antarctica during the Italian expeditions in 1993, 1997 and 2001, and in the Arctic during 2002. During the 2001-2002 Antarctic expedition, he carried out the E-Robot Project, the first experiment of internet robotics via satellite in the Antarctica. In 2002, he designed and developed the Project E-Robot2, the first experiment of worldwide internet robotics ever carried out in the Arctic. During these projects, he organized a series of “live-science” sessions in collaboration with students and teachers of Italian schools. Beginning with his new “School of Robotics”, Veruggio continued to disseminate and educate young people on the complex relationship between robotics and society. This led him to coin the term and propose the concept of Roboethics in 2002, and he has since made worldwide efforts at dedicating resources to the development of this new field. He was the General Chair of the “First International Symposium on Roboethics” in 2004 and of the “EURON Roboethics Atelier” in 2006 that produced the Roboethics Roadmap. Veruggio is the author of more than 150 scientific publications. In 2006, he was presented with the Ligurian Region Award for Innovation, and in 2009, for his merits in the field of science and society, he was awarded the title of Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, one of Italy’s highest civilian honors.",,30

As one of the notable results, the open architecture allows system engineers at user side to design a feedback control system to develop robotic applications. However, porting of an application software into different makers’ industrial robots is not easy even though having an open architecture, because the specifications of interface between PC-based controllers and robots are not standardized yet. In this paper, easy transplantation of a robotic application is tried by using ORiN (Open Robot/Resource interface for the Network) middleware interface. The application is the trajectory-following controller with vibrational motion used in a machining robot. First, the removability of undesirable cusp marks on a flat surface is examined through machining experiments. Then, portability of the controller into a small-sized educational robot VE026A with ORiN SDK (Software Development Kit) is evaluated on a simulation environment called WINCAPS III.

Therefore, a new element was introduced into the virtual environment - a device to simulate real objects. In the Virtual Environment (VE), user interacted with a simulated object, and the task of the Delta robot was moving into a position which enabled the interaction. In this way, VE has become more responsive because it corresponded to the behavior of the user, who can move and interact with digital objects and directly experience their physical properties (e.g. size, shape).

However, obtaining and using suitable kits or hardware can involve significant financial outlay for a school. Additionally maintaining, storing and using the physical hardware presents many practical problems for teachers. These factors combine to create a significant entry barrier, especially for teachers who have previously not used robots and may be lacking confidence or motivation to use physical computing as a teaching aid. Robotic simulation provides a good alternative as it provides the experience and many of the benefits of working with robots to be gained at low cost, using computers already available in school. A software platform which meets this need is CoSpace Rescue. This has been created by Singapore Polytechnic as an educational tool and provides a simulation platform for RoboCupJunior. This platform allows students to experience event driven programming by developing search strategies to find and deposit coloured objects, whilst avoiding obstacles and traps. CoSpace was introduced to the UK in 2013 coincident with the introduction of a new compulsory national computing curriculum for England. The approach used to introduce CoSpace into schools and the relevance that CoSpace has to the new curriculum for England are presented in this paper. Four teams have now represented the UK at international RoboCupJunior competitions and the UK national competition, now in its third year, is already attracting over 100 competing teams with over 300 schools making use of the CoSpace Platform nationwide.",,30

In particular, in an educational and research setting, it is vital that students experiment both with equation-based models and the real system that is being modeled. In this work-in-progress paper, we present a physical experimental robotic arm platform that is designed for teaching and research.

The platform is completely open source, where electronic schematics, CAD models for 3D printing, controller software, and component specifications are available on GitHub.

Improved quantity and quality of information are resulting in rapid advances in science and engineering. Today a megabyte of semiconductor memory is very affordable for the common man. By 2020, one desktop computer will equal all the computers currently in Silicon Valley. The 21st C highly competitive IT sector is making things faster, cheaper and smaller. Information technologies are connecting every part of the world, and also enabling development of major new technologies like automated knowledge work tools, advanced robotics and 3D printing. IT progress will revolutionize production, transportation, energy, commerce, education and health. While this will certainly result in more environmentally sustainable products through a less wasteful production process, there will also be a serious impact on the demographic equilibrium of the world, if effective countermeasures are not put in place by business leaders and policy makers. It will affect the way business is done. Intermediaries are now fast disappearing, and businesses can pass on the benefits to the customers. Tomorrow’s Information Technologies will radically improve the capacity to communicate and simulate. It will lead to learning by “doing”, joint experimental research and moving at one’s own pace for every “wired” person. But increasing technology has increased the risk of natural and man made threats. It is also difficult to adopt new attitudes, and accept alternative approaches to risk management. It requires concerted efforts on part of individuals, businesses and policy makers. The paper analyses the 21st C scenario and the various measures that need to be taken to counter the risks and threats. The author concludes that public opinion will have to ensure that emerging new technologies, which by their very nature vest in the hands of corporate giants, are harnessed for the common good and for sustainable development. This research which is primarily based on secondary sources can be enriched by a primary investigation of the methods employed by the corporate, the governments and the non-government bodies to face the challenges and the risks arising out of the technologies emerging in the 21st century.",,30

These parameters, in turn, are function of associated control law. Multi-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) robotic arms, because of their inherent highly non-linear dynamics, demand sophisticated control laws. Trivial control strategies fail to cope with disturbances and uncertainties that are common in today’s plants. This paper presents the design, simulation and physical implementation of a non-linear control technique Variable Structure Control (VSC) for a 6 DOF arm. Based on the derived dynamic model of the arm and designed control law, simulations have been conducted in MATLAB/Simulink. The controller parameters have been tuned for optimal response. Various desired trajectories characterize the tracking performance of the control law. The simulation results have been then validated by implementing the law on a custom-developed novel AUTonomous Articulated Robotic Educational Platform (AUTAREP). Coupling effects between various joints of the robot have also been investigated. Results of this research find potential in industrial control of robotic manipulators to perform complex tasks.

The aim of this research is to design an experimental setup that proves whether a 1D deformation model can be scaled for complex geometries. The setup includes a laser displacement sensor mounted on a robotic arm capable of scanning a specimen surface and measuring its deformation. The reproducibility of the results is verified by comparing the present results with Stony Brook University Laboratory’s results. The Δk-ΔT slope error is less than 8%, and the E d estimation error is close to 2%. These values reveal the repeatability of the experiments. Several samples fabricated with aluminum as the substrate and 100MXC nanowire (Fe and Cr alloy) as the deposit are analyzed and compared with those in finite element (FE) simulations. The linear elastic behavior of 1D (flat long plate) and 2D (squared plate) specimens during heating/cooling cycles is demonstrated by the high linearity of all Δk-ΔT curves (over 97%). The E d values are approximately equal for 1D and 2D analyses, with a median of 96 GPa and standard deviation of 2 GPa. The correspondence between the experimental and simulated results for the 1D and 2D specimens reveals that deformation and thermal stress in coated specimens can be predicted regardless of specimen geometry through FE modeling and by using the experimental value of E d.

Such simulations can be used for effective training of future operators of a given workplace and testing its ergonomic quality without need of building a physical prototype. The authors have devised several different approaches to preparation of virtual workplace prototypes for training. The basic approach is utilization of immersive VR systems (Head-Mounted Devices combined with user tracking solutions) to create an interactive simulation of a workplace, on the basis of its CAD model and specification of a realized process. The second approach is using a haptic manipulator with force feedback for interaction with a virtual workplace, for more realistic feeling of a realized activity. The third, novel approach is combination of the two previous approaches. A special system was designed and built for this purpose. It uses a large-space robot to allow haptic feedback for a user equipped with an immersive set of devices.

More and more often virtual prototypes of the workplaces replace the physical ones as an innovative training solutions that allow to train the future operators or improve ergonomic quality of the workplace. The reason for that is the reduction of costs needed to develop the real prototype of the workstation as well as ability of complex virtual workplaces to change the variants in order to investigate different situations. Usually such workplaces - created as interactive Virtual Reality applications - consist of a visualization operated with aid of advanced Virtual Reality systems and devices. Implementation of an immersive equipment increases sense of user's presence and use of haptic devices with force feedback makes the experience more similar to reality.

The level of realism is a very important factor in an immersive and haptic simulations of workstations for training purposes. As a form of instructional simulation, also called educational simulation, immersive and haptic simulations are a powerful learning tools that require trained users to complete tasks or to solve specific problems within VR environment that replicates the real workplace conditions19. Trainings conducted is this way are particularly beneficial when real activities and task conducted at the workplace is too dangerous, too costly or even almost impossible to do.

The two basic approaches presented by the authors are innovative and important on their own, but they usually do not mix, as state-of-the-art haptic devices are stationary. Their application heavily limits spatial freedom of a user, which does not affect the level of realism of presented simulations in a positive way. In order to fully simulate the conditions of an assembly workplace, tactile input must be available, with simultaneous immersion of a user into a Virtual Environment (VE) using a HMD or a CAVE system combined with the user tracking solution. The third approach to simulation of workplace conditions, proposed by the authors, allows to bring a realistic force feedback into an immersive visualization. Thanks to this, operations like assembling a threaded joint between two parts can be trained more realistically than before, without need of building a full physical workplace.",,30

By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, a NAO humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been configured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner.

In order to do this, the toolbox aims at the fulfillment of a set of practical sessions that allow the students to test most of the concepts of an introductory course in robotic manipulators. In addition, the library possesses features that typically needed the usage of proprietary software, such as the visualization of a realistic 3D representation of commercial robotic arms and the programming of those arms in an industrial language. The practices include the concepts of direct and inverse kinematics, inverse and direct dynamics, path planning and robot programming. As a transversal practice, during the sessions, the student is asked to choose and integrate a new robotic arm in the library, proposing a particular solution to the direct and inverse kinematic problem, as well as the inclusion of other important parameters. The library has been deployed during the last year in bachelor and master studies and has received a nice acceptance. Finally, the library has been assessed in terms of usefulness, design and usage by means of a student survey.

This paper aims to present the design of a modular robot with 3D-printing technology.

Design/methodology/approach

The robot consists of a number of autonomous modules coupled by magnetic interfaces. Each module combines 3D-printed mechanical parts with widely available standard electronic components, including a microcontroller and a single servo actuator. The mechanical and electrical connection is provided by a single set of magnets which apply the physical force between the modules and at the same time serve as wires for power and communication.

Findings

The PMR is a full-featured robotic device, well integrated into a simulation framework, capable to execute common locomotion patterns but still extremely affordable (approximately 25/module). Furthermore, the design is easy to extend and replicate for other research and education groups.

Originality/value

This paper explores a novel approach of connecting devices in a complex way by utilizing very simple magnetic parts. A second focus lies on the concept of closely integrating simulation and hardware development, blurring the edge between digital and physical word.",,30

It provides a place where students, educators, and academic researchers can easily create and share their computer models of physical systems described using Modelica, a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation-based language for physical system modeling. It comes with a web-based, graphical modeling, and simulation tool called ProteusGWT (http://www.visualphysics.net/ProteusGWT). ProteusGWT is web-based and uses an intuitive, graphical component-oriented approach to the modeling of physical systems spanning multiple domains including systems containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermal, control, electrical, electronic, electric power, or process-oriented subcomponents. It synthesizes state-of-the-art web technologies (e.g., HTML5, GWT, and cloud computing), computational methods for physical systems modeling, and simulation to create a computing environment that is widely deployable and scalable. Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a development toolkit from Google for building and optimizing complex web-based applications. It allows developers to create and maintain complex JavaScript applications in Java language. Proteus allows anyone with a computer or browser-enabled device to be able to use it. Hence, anyone can contribute their computer models of physical systems to this platform. As this platform grows, it could turn out to be an online interactive repository for all kinds of physical system models, for example, a student may examine complete computer models of a motorcycle, a refrigerator, a burglar alarm, or robot arm and learn about how they work.

ROS is an open-source library that is commonly used for the development of robotic applications since it provides standard services and promotes large-scale integrative robotic research. SimTwo is a realistic simulation software suitable for test and design of several types of robots. This simulator conducts realistic navigation procedures, since the driving systems, the sensors, the mechanical and physical properties of the bodies are precisely odeled.

The method for choosing six non-redundant actuated joints for the parallel manipulator from all twelve optional joints is elaborated.

Whilst this environment is the first 3D environment dedicated to interpreter-mediated communication, research in other educational contexts suggests that such environments can foster learning. The IVY 3D environment offers a range of virtual ‘locations’ (e.g. business meeting room, tourist office, doctor’s surgery) which serve as backdrops for the practice of consecutive and dialogue interpreting in business and public service contexts. The locations are populated with relevant objects and with robot-avatars who act as speakers by presenting recorded monologues and bilingual dialogues. Students, represented by their own avatars, join them to practise interpreting. This article focuses on the development of the bilingual dialogues, which are at the heart of many interpreter-mediated business and public service encounters but which are notoriously difficult to obtain for educational purposes. Given that interpreter training institutions usually need to offer bilingual resources of comparable difficulty levels in many language combinations, ad hoc approaches to the creation of such materials are normally ruled out. The approach outlined here was therefore to start from available corpora of spoken language that were designed with pedagogical applications in mind. The article begins by explaining how the dialogues were created and then discusses the benefits and potential shortcomings of this approach in the context of interpreter education. The main points of discussion concern (1) the level of systematicity and authenticity that can be achieved with this corpus-based approach; and (2) the potential of a 3D virtual environment to increase this sense of authenticity and thus to enable students to experience the essence of dialogue interpreting in a simulated environment.",,30

Surrogates can be directly controlled or just given a specific task to carry out on behalf of a human. In the context of a virtual environment, a surrogate is more often referred to as an avatar, reflecting that it is intended to represent the person in some context, rather than just carrying out a specific task on his or her behalf. In essence, an avatar is a manifestation of the human who is ""inhabiting"" it. A person's avatar can look like the inhabiter or look like some other person, or even be a personification of some non-human character Generally, the inhabiter controls all critical actions, verbal and non-verbal, of his or her avatar, although the specific manifestation of the avatar may place constraints on how it carries out some of these desired behaviors.

The research presented here involves the use of avatars and other forms of human surrogates as remote entities that can be employed for situations that involve interpersonal skills. More specifically, we focus on the use of avatars in collaborative situations and in the delivery of training and education, especially when physical co-presence is difficult or even undesirable. In these contexts, difficulty most often relates to spatial separation of the human participants and undesirability relates to the need to have one's surrogate present an appearance and exist in a context that differs from one's own. For other situations, such as carrying out dangerous or humanly impossible physical tasks, a remote avatar may be required for safety or even successful completion. In Smart Cities, human surrogates and avatars can help make people more effective, safer, better educated and more facile at learning new skills required for employment and other life events.",,30

This work presents a set of techniques to improve the cross-compatibility between the Webots simulator and the educational e-puck mobile robot. The work is motivated by the need of a realistic simulation environment, especially designed to consider the unique challenges associated to multi-robot systems (MRS), such as the robot–robot interaction (RRI). This article starts by proposing a new Webots programming architecture that provides full control of the e-puck’s firmware. By doing so, one can easily improve the already existing e-puck’s functionalities on Webots, as well as adding new functionalities required by most MRS applications. Among the range of new possible functionalities, this article describes the successful implementation of the microphone, the speaker, and the Bluetooth for robot–robot communication. Due to the limitations of the e-puck’s Bluetooth modules, this work goes even further by bringing some insights about the Gumstix Overo COM turret and how robot–robot communication may be achieved using WiFi technology. The outcomes provided by the experiments conducted using both virtual and real e-pucks under the Webots framework open new doors for low-cost multi-robot applications.",,30

In this article, we present an active learning experience based on simulation tools in the framework of robotics courses taught at engineering degrees. It is well known that the field of robotics involves many disciplines taught in higher education, such as mechanics, electronics, or computer science. In the context of a robotics course for an Industrial Engineering Masters degree, the different topics addressed can benefit from the use of simulation tools. Additionally, the benefits of active learning activities have been widely acknowledged and discussed. The main contribution of this work is the simulation tools fully integrated in the project-based activity designed. Thus, one of the contributions is the software provided, developed with a clear teaching focus, and the successful teaching experience with a high academic level thanks in part to the simulation tools.

This common introductory robotics course generally covers the fundamental theory of robotics including robot kinematics, dynamics, differential movements, trajectory planning and basic computer vision algorithms commonly used in the field of robotics. The nature of this material almost necessitates the use of robotic hardware to allow the students to practice implementing the theory they learn in class. That is, to fully understand the material, it is necessary for the students to implement algorithms and observe the results on hardware. This paper introduces a software based educational tool designed to be used in introductory robotics courses. The software simulates the geometry of motion (kinematics) of a two link robotic arm and is used by students to implement algorithms based on the robot's kinematic equations. This includes the use of inverse kinematic equations used to determine the joint inputs based on the desired location of the end-effector, as well as trajectory planning and the study of differential movements. It also include a robotic image processing tool that helps the student design robotic vision algorithms.

The use of surgical simulators outside of the operating room, in a low-stakes environment, has been shown to shorten such learning curves. We present a multidisciplinary validation study of a robotic surgery simulator, the da Vinci® Skills Simulator (dVSS). Trainees and attending faculty from the University of Toronto, Departments of Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynecology (ObGyn), were recruited to participate in this validation study. All participants completed seven different exercises on the dVSS (Camera Targeting 1, Peg Board 1, Peg Board 2, Ring Walk 2, Match Board 1, Thread the Rings, Suture Sponge 1) and, using the da Vinci S Robot (dVR), completed two standardized skill tasks (Ring Transfer, Needle Passing). Participants were categorized as novice robotic surgeon (NRS) and experienced robotic surgeon (ERS) based on the number of robotic cases performed. Statistical analysis was conducted using independent T test and non-parametric Spearman’s correlation. A total of 53 participants were included in the study: 27 urology, 13 ObGyn, and 13 thoracic surgery (Table 1). Most participants (89 %) either had no prior console experience or had performed <10 robotic cases, while one (2 %) had performed 10–20 cases and five (9 %) had performed ≥20 robotic surgeries. The dVSS demonstrated excellent face and content validity and 97 and 86 % of participants agreed that it was useful for residency training and post-graduate training, respectively. The dVSS also demonstrated construct validity, with NRS performing significantly worse than ERS on most exercises with respect to overall score, time to completion, economy of motion, and errors (Table 2). Excellent concurrent validity was also demonstrated as dVSS scores for most exercises correlated with performance of the two standardized skill tasks using the dVR (Table 3). This multidisciplinary validation study of the dVSS provides excellent face, content, construct, and concurrent validity evidence, which supports its integrated use in a comprehensive robotic surgery training program, both as an educational tool and potentially as an assessment device.

During medical education and training, several methods will be put to use such as watching video, reading books, making use of the simulated patient (SP), and so on. These can help medical staffs, especially novices, to master the skills and accumulate experiences. To make up for the drawbacks of the above methods, such as lack of active interactions, limitation of multi-symptom reproductions, etc, the medical training simulators have been developed to improve training effectiveness. However, most of these simulators only mimic the symptoms. They have no the abilities to show the pathology of diseases. This limits the training effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an elbow robot named WKE-1(Waseda Kyotokagaku Elbow Robot No.1) for neurologic examination training as one part of the whole body patient robot named WKP (Waseda Kyotokagaku Patient). In this robot, we simulate various symptoms occurring during the examination of elbow force, biceps tendon reflex, involuntary action, and also make a physiological neurological model to simulate the pathology of the nervous system.

Specifically, motion analysis includes tracking the body, tool, or hand motions of a surgeon, either from teleoperated robotic systems or surgical simulators using different sensors like wireless or electromagnetic motion tracking sensors, video-glove-based input devices, optical tracking system, or magnetic tracking technologies. Sometimes data explored form this method is synchronized with eye-gaze data (what a surgeon looks at while operating), or videographic data. Using motion analysis actually the number of movements, rate of movements, total path length, movement variability, time taken to complete the operation, average or peak velocity are considered for assessing surgical skills. On the other hand, the methods in the second group assess the skills based on force and toque data that surgeons apply through surgical instruments. More specifically, these methods use different kind of sensors placed on the grasper. Different force and torque measurement systems, hidden-Markov-model-based analysis, simulated models with criteria, and Virtual reality have been developed, allowing for the quantification of the performance of surgeons.

Although, each method has its own advantageous, and according to the kind of surgical task and evaluation, these methods can be used successfully to assess surgical skills, to provide predictive validity for each of these methods more study is needed. Also, future works should improve the efficiency of each method and move toward automated, low-cost and real time assessment methods.",,30

VR simulation technology is also a well-known field of virtual training and engineering today and widely applied in research and development in a broad range of different domains. Due to the wide availability of realistic computer graphics in our day-to-day life, our eyes get spoiled by stunning computer generated virtual worlds nowadays; thus, the acceptance of these applications depends more and more on the realistic, state-of-the-art rendering of the virtual environment, as well as the convenient usage.

Automobile industry has been investing a lot in security systems (e.g., airbags, ABS brakes, vehicle proximity warning systems). However, drivers are still the ones who have to act in order to avoid collisions, by using the brakes or maneuvering the car.
The purpose of this project is to develop an anti-collision logic that can be used on automobile vehicles to avoid collisions with both static and moving objects by interfering on the vehicle behavior. The control system is based on a fuzzy modeled controller using the MATLAB and Simulink tools from Math Works.
The prototype chosen to test the logic was the Robotino, a mobile robot system made by Festo Didactic, and used for educational, training and research purposes. Robotino is able to integrate to Simulink tool natively, and provides out-of-the-box sensors and actuators, so the developers are able to focus the efforts on the software itself.
Integrated simulations were done using FESTO Robotino Simulator to validate whether the proposed system meets the objectives or not.

This paper addresses the goal of revolutionizing student education using collaborative gaming and competition, both in virtual simulation environments and on real hardware in space. The concept is demonstrated using the SPHERES Zero Robotics (ZR) Program which is a robotics programming competition. The robots are miniature satellites called SPHERES—an experimental test bed developed by the MIT SSL on the International Space Station (ISS) to test navigation, formation flight and control algorithms in microgravity. The participants compete to win a technically challenging game by programming their strategies into the SPHERES satellites, completely from a web browser. The programs are demonstrated in simulation, on ground hardware and then in a final competition when an astronaut runs the student software aboard the ISS. ZR had a pilot event in 2009 with 10 High School (HS) students, a nationwide pilot tournament in 2010 with over 200 HS students from 19 US states, a summer tournament in 2010 with ∼150 middle school students and an open-registration tournament in 2011 with over 1000 HS students from USA and Europe. The influence of collaboration was investigated by (1) building new web infrastructure and an Integrated Development Environment where intensive inter-participant collaboration is possible, (2) designing and programming a game to solve a relevant formation flight problem, collaborative in nature—and (3) structuring a tournament such that inter-team collaboration is mandated. This paper introduces the ZR web tools, assesses the educational value delivered by the program using space and games and evaluates the utility of collaborative gaming within this framework. There were three types of collaborations as variables—within matches (to achieve game objectives), inter-team alliances and unstructured communication on online forums. Simulation competition scores, website usage statistics and post-competition surveys are used to evaluate educational impact and the effect of collaboration.

The Victorian Space Science Education Centre (VSSEC) uses scenario-based learning in its Mission to Mars, Mission to the Orbiting Space Laboratory and Primary Expedition to the M.A.R.S.

These programs utilize methodologies such as hands-on applications, immersive-learning, integrated technologies, critical thinking and mentoring to engage students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and highlight potential career paths in science and engineering. The immersive nature of the programs demands specialist environments such as a simulated Mars environment, Mission Control and Space Laboratory, thus restricting these programs to a physical location and limiting student access to the programs. To move beyond these limitations, VSSEC worked with its university partners to develop a web-based mission that delivered the benefits of scenario-based learning within a school environment.

The pedagogical objectives of this “learning layer” cover various aspects, namely: give the student the opportunity to exploit and analyze the equations of motion for a real application, make them able to formulate consistent hypotheses for such applications and promote an actual multi-disciplinary activity (mechanics, numerical methods, computer science and CAD). The project is performed by groups of students and is organized in the frame of a global active pedagogical process which characterizes our undergraduate engineering program at the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL, Belgium). After more than 10 years of experience, we can claim that this multi-disciplinary project really improves the student's skills in the field of multibody system modeling and computer simulation, including a timid but existing engineering attitude with respect to the results they obtain. Among the educational ingredients that make this project really fruitful educationally speaking, one must emphasize a key point of the approach, relating to the use of the symbolic multibody program ROBOTRAN to assist students in producing their equations of motion. Contrarily to research activities, the use of the ROBOTRAN symbolic models are exploited in such project, more for an educational motivation than for the computer efficiency of the simulation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

At first the structure of the robot is described in brief and its inverse kinematics is presented. Then the dynamic model is formulated as based on the Lagrange equations. A novel index of total torque is proposed by considering the posture of the supporting legs. The new index can be used to optimize the leg’s structure and operation for consuming minimum power and avoiding unstable postures of the robot.

To quickly realize new applications at low costs, the reuse of existing functionality is of high importance. In the area of mobile robotics, physics based simulation components promise optimal reusability: The physical laws always stay the same and do not depend on the application. Hence, as long as the applications try to emulate reality, physics based simulation software will be reusable. Unfortunately, depending on the kind of application, different simulation models for different physical domains are needed: Particle models for fluids and soil, finite-elements for non-rigid bodies, multi-body systems and so on. However, for those applications developed at Institute for Man-Machine Interaction at the RWTH Aachen University, a multi-body dynamics component has taken a central role in the process of application development. It is fully integrated within a modern 3D-simulation and visualization tool. It is enhanced by generalized tools of contact graph analysis, which support the fast development of robust applications suitable for daily use. The paper discusses the benefit of this multi-body system as a platform for versatile application development, taking the following three applications as examples: The first example is the development of forest machine simulators for usage in education and training of machine operators. The existence of a purely kinematically realized, phenomenological implementation with widely equivalent range of functions allows a direct comparison of the programming efforts. The second example is the development of algorithms for space robot motion planning. The example demonstrates, how easy and effective innovative robotic simulation applications can be realized using a common, dynamics based simulation framework. The third example finally describes the development of a Virtual Testbed for legged lunar exploration robots. The Virtual Testbed example handles in detail the concept of “top-down-development” of simulation models. The refinement of the simulation of foot-soil-contact situations using a force exchange interface and the refinement of the actuator dynamics simulation using an energy exchange interface serve as examples.",,30

While these provide certain benefits, they can also cause muscle atrophy. In this study, we examined NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) wires that were annealed into springs to develop an active, soft orthotic (ASO) for the knee. Actively controlled SMA springs may provide variable assistances depending on factors such as when, during the gait cycle, the springs are activated; ongoing muscle activity level; and needs of the wearer. Unlike a passive brace, an active orthotic may provide individualized control, assisting the muscles so that they may be used more appropriately, and possibly leading to a re-education of the neuro-motor system and eventual independence from the orthotic system. A prototype was tested on a suspended, robotic leg to simulate the swing phase of a typical gait. The total deflection generated by the orthotic depended on the knee angle and the total number of actuators triggered, with a max deflection of 35°. While SMA wires have a high energy density, they require a significant amount of power.

Behavioural models are particularly important for top-down design of multidisciplinary products such as mechatronic systems. During the conceptual design of such systems, intended “operational behavior” of the artifact is described without any physical realization. As design stages become more concrete, operational behaviour can be refined so as to represent well defined mathematical descriptions of corresponding physical behaviors. In this study, a model for representing the intended operational behaviour of a nonexistent educational robot, namely a rabbit robot, is presented for conceptual design. The operational behaviour of the robot is defined as composed of states and state transitions independent of any physical embodiment.

This welded volcanic tuff is neither highlands- or maria-like in composition, being at best only half-way between in FeO content, and is only typical of a 2–3 % by area of the lunar surface. Indeed, JSC-1A has the wrong mineralogy [e.g., it has no ilmenite, yet has been used for hydrogen reduction of ilmenite, as well as for as feedstock for several other oxygen-production and ISRU processes.] And largely because of the blessings of NASA in the production of JSC-1, similar lunar simulants have been effectively duplicated by other nations (e.g., China, Japan). The Minnesota Lunar Simulant (MLS-1) was a reasonable hi-Ti mare soil simulant in composition, yet has been abandoned by NASA. When NASA MSFC got into the lunar simulant business, lunar soil experts repeatedly advised that ""one size does not fit all"", meaning that each lunar soil simulant should only be used for very specific purposes. But the education of the engineering community has not been sufficient such that ""high-quality studies are still being performed on the wrong simulants"". Also, lunar soil simulants are being produced supposedly with certain properties, which are in reality definitely not proper lunar simulants For example, simulants with nanophase metallic Fe are far from being similar to lunar soils; JSC-1A made with nanophase Fe has an order of magnitude more nanophase magnetite than metallic Fe, so what good is this product? Indeed, most people questioned are not really sure what or why they are trying to simulate nanophase Fe: magnetic susceptibility? Dielectric properties? Toxicity? A review of the unique properties of lunar samples required for studies in engineering and applied sciences (exclusive of biology) is conducted here.

Since most of the industrial robot manipulators are produced with six degrees of freedom (DOF) such as the PUMA 560, the Fanuc ArcMate 120iB and Stanford Arm, the library of the toolbox includes sixteen fundamental 6-DOF robot manipulators with Euler wrist. The software can be used to interactively perform robotics analysis and off-line programming of robot dynamics such as forward and inverse dynamics as well as to interactively teach and simulate the basic principles of robot dynamics in a very realistic way. In order to demonstrate the user-friendly features of the toolbox much better, simulation of the NS robot manipulator (Stanford Arm) is provided as an example. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, a novel robot toolbox, “ROBOLAB” is developed for the educational users to improve the understanding of robotics fundamentals through interactive real-time simulation. To understand manipulator movement in 3-D space with increasing number of joints is very difficult for engineering students; because the mathematical model between joint space and physical space becomes more complex. In order to overcome this complexity, ROBOLAB based on MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) includes a library for the 16 different 6 degree of freedom (6-DOF) fundamental serial robot manipulators. The user has option to view an animation of the robot manipulators with choosing one of them or to create own GUIs based on robot project. ROBOLAB provides valuable analysis tools to students and engineering professionals in which they can compute rotation and transformation matrix, forward and inverse kinematics, and trajectory planning. Additionally, it allows user to use powerful MATLAB features such as controlling over data and formatting. In order to illustrate the features of ROBOLAB, RS cylindrical robot manipulator is given here as an example.

From a largely dominant industrial focus, robotics has undergone, by the turn of the new millennium, a major transformation in scope and dimensions. This expansion has been brought about by the maturity of the field and the advances in its related technologies to address the pressing needs for human-centered robotic applications. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives, in homes, workplaces, and communities, providing support in services, entertainment, education, manufacturing, personal health care, and assistance. The successful introduction of robots in human environments will rely on the development of competent and practical systems that are dependable, safe, and easy to use. This presentation focuses on the efforts to develop human-friendly robotic systems that combine the essential characteristics of safety, human-compatibility, and performance with emphasis on (i) new design concepts and novel sensing modalities; (ii) efficient planning and whole-body robot control strategies; and (iii) robotic-based synthesis of human motion and skills.

In human-friendly robot design, our effort has focused on the development of intrinsically safe robotic systems that possess the requisite capabilities and performance to interact and work with humans. The novel design concept was based on a hybrid actuation approach that consists of biomimetic pneumatic muscles combined with small electric motors. The flexible muscles and the lightweight mechanism allow for human safety, while the electric motors compensate for the slower dynamics and nonlinearities of the pneumatics. This concept was shown to significantly decrease the inherent danger of robotic manipulators, as measured in terms of the reflected mass perceived at the point of impact. Safety can be further enhanced by the addition of robot skin to provide impact reduction and tactile sensing capabilities for advanced sensor based behaviors.

Redundancy is a major challenge in the planning and control of humanoid robots. Inspired by human behaviors, our early work in robot control encoded tasks and diverse constraints into artificial potential fields capturing human-like goal-driven behaviors. To implement such behaviors on robots with complex human-like structures we developed a unified whole-body task-oriented control structure that addresses dynamics in the context of multiple tasks, multi-point contacts, and multiple constraints. The performance and effectiveness of this approach have been demonstrated through extensive robot dynamic simulations and implementations on physical robots for experimental validation. The new framework provides a multi-task prioritized control architecture allowing the simultaneous execution of multiple objectives in a hierarchical manner, analogous to natural human motion.

Initially motivated by the development of human-like skills in robotics, our extensive study of human musculoskeletal system has brought insights and results that proved extremely valuable in human biomechanics. Understanding human motion is a complex procedure that requires accurate reconstruction of movement sequences, modeling of musculoskeletal kinematics, dynamics, and actuation, and suitable criteria for the characterization of performance. These issues have much in common with the problems of articulated body systems studied in robotics research. Building on methodologies and techniques developed in robotics, a host of new effective tools have been established for the synthesis of human motion. These include efficient algorithms for the simulation of musculoskeletal systems, novel physio-mechanical criteria and performance measures, real-time tracking and reconstruction of human motion, and accurate human performance characterization. These developments are providing new avenues for exploring human motion – with exciting prospects for novel clinical therapies, athletic training, and performance improvement.",,30

With Special Reference to the Emergency Department,ch,Chapter,Escott M.,Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,Hershey,United States,Clinical Simulation,Book,,127-133,0,"Publisher Summary

The use of high-fidelity simulation in Emergency Medicine has rapidly expanded over the past decade. Complex scenarios required that instructors read aloud from written scripts to describe the patient's changing conditions, forcing the learners to contribute a significant amount of imagination. Where adequate simulators did not exist, students would be taught by first observing one or several procedures, followed by performing the procedure on a patient under supervision, and eventually on their own. Emergency procedures were learned in this apprenticeship manner. The integration of part-task trainers and full-body high-fidelity robotic patient simulators into clinical education has dramatically changed medical educators' ability to suspend disbelief and utilize preprogrammed scenarios to achieve standardization and complexities that were not previously possible. Utilizing this approach for training allows them to minimize the risks to patients, challenging the limitations of the traditional “see one, do one, teach one” axiom. Advanced clinical simulation is also useful to achieve the new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education guidelines established for resident training in patient evaluation and management. This chapter describes authors' experience with incorporating simulation technology into an emergency medicine residency training curriculum as it relates to teaching and evaluating various patient management skills.",,30

This chapter addresses the structural-functional relationships of the various simulation spaces and offers suggestions on how to plan both their physical designs and their uses to create an integrated whole where these diverse relationships complement and reinforce each other. You can design spaces for standardized patient encounters, task-trainer skills development, or full-body robotic patient simulator scenarios. Typically, for in-hospital care teachings, the latter are staged in rooms that look like the real environments that the simulated events are expected to occur in: the labor and delivery suite, operating rooms, emergency rooms, intensive care units, and patient recovery wards. The very presence of any heterogeneous structure inhabited by diverse users both generates and constrains the latter's relationships with, and utility from, the structure. Mindful use of structure-function relationships allows your simulation center to become a living entity that provides the optimal learning environment while being adaptable to a variety of learner-educator experiences and needs. Structure-function relationships are not intuitively obvious. It is more than the position of the walls, doors, and windows in your simulation space. You need to establish meaningful linkages in your simulation center between the basic scientific principles and clinical practice while being cognizant of what are the educationally important questions. In the educational realm, we have to be aware of not only the simulation-based learning principles, but also how the interactions of the learning environment affect the trainee, the actors, etc., during their educational endeavors. The chapter shares some of the thoughts of the designers and wise counsel from experienced operators of established simulation centers.",,30

PISCES was created by the University of Hawaii under the auspices of the Japan-US Science, Technology and Space Applications Program (JUSTSAP), and has recently been funded by the State of Hawaii through the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT). This new center will be built on partnerships between industry, academia and the governments of spacefaring nations, adopting a model that has seen wide success in such programs as the NASA Research Partnership Centers (RPCs), the NASA Robotic Engineering Consortium at Carnegie Mellon University, and numerous programs within NIST, the Department of Commerce and the National Science Foundation. In addition to its research and development mission, PISCES will function as an education, research and technology development center; a training center for astronauts, scientists, K-12 and university students; and a public outreach resource for local residents and tourists to experience the multitude of scientific, educational and economic benefits that space exploration could bring to Hawaii. New technologies developed in PISCES and at universities and industries around the world will require testing in an environment simulating as closely as possible that found on the Moon. Several nations plan robotic exploration missions to the Moon in the next few years, and PISCES will be an important proving ground for hardware developed through collaborative projects in science and technology. To validate space operations, new system architectures, designs, materials and mechanisms had to be developed, such as a robotic vehicle called ATHLETE (the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed, Extra-Terrestrial Explorer), and materials had to be utilized from space. This ATHLETE vehicle concept is capable of efficient rolling mobility on moderate terrain and walking mobility on extreme terrain. Each limb has a quick-disconnect tool adapter and associated tools so that it can perform general-purpose handling, drilling, scooping, assembly, maintenance and servicing tasks using any or all of the limbs. Each of ATHLETE's 6-degree freedom limbs is equipped with non-pneumatic, lunar-appropriate, compliant wheels to enable rolling mobility in soft soil. Also, new ISRU materials and designs had to be developed to accommodate the space environment to sustain human settlements, deal with moon dust, and ensure very long-duration operations. Astronauts embarking on exploration missions and long stays on the Moon will need training in the use of these new technologies to free themselves from the drudgery of routine chores and to increase their time for scientific and technological achievements.

Today's students, however, often face great frustration when they work with the unfamiliar QBASIC language and the even more unfamiliar DOS operating system. To address these shortcomings, the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Department at Miami University introduced MATLAB as an alternative Window-based interface language to better reflect the current educational experience of students and to increase the functionality of the RV-M1 robotic arms. MATLAB successfully overcomes the limitations of the QBASIC/DOS environment and augments the capability of the RV-M1. Examples of the extended capability include the use of graphical user interfaces to facilitate student interaction with the robotic arm and the ability to move the robot along contoured paths.

This chapter describes the way students at the UJI University (Jaume I University of Castellon) are able to design remote visual servoing experiments from any computer connected to the Internet. These experiments are able to control a set of real robotic devices such as manipulators, cameras, and sensors. It means the experiments are finally executed on real robots instead of 3D simulations.

In fact, the experiments presented in this chapter focus on the on-hand visual servoing problem, which has been possible thanks to the images obtained from a camera mounted on the gripper of an educational robot.

Moreover, the Distributed Network Architecture is presented, which permits any external algorithm to have access to the state and services of several network robots (e.g. robots control, network cameras, object recognition, etc) [17] [16]. We call this architecture SNRP (Simple Network Robot Protocol), due to the fact that commanding a robot via Internet follows a very simple Web Service protocol.

Simplicity is maybe the most important challenge of a network robotics architecture, due to the fact that it must be possible for a very broad range of devices to be part of it. In fact, thanks to this simplicity we were able to implement a prototype of SNRP Network Camera using an FPGA.

The last part of the article explains how the system can execute remote experiments that use several SNRP robots in a concurrent and synchronized manner. As an example two educational manipulators and a mobile robot are used to simulate an industrial task.",,30

The finite element-based dynamic model of flexible parallel robots is proposed. The relation between elastic deformations and elastic displacements of the flexible links is investigated, considering the coupling effects of elastic motion and rigid motion. The elastic deformations of links are calculated. Considering the effects of bending-shearing strain and tensile-compression strain, the dynamic stress of the links and its position are derived by using the Kineto-Elastodynamics theory and the Timoshenko beam theory. Due to the flexibility of the links, the dynamic stresses are well illustrated through numerical simulation. Compared with the results of the finite element software SAMCEF, the numerical simulation results show the good coherence and advantages of the analysis method.

We introduce a simulation study designed to develop a “synthetic psychology” (Braitenberg, 1984). Instead of studying real human/animal behavior, we study autonomous behavior of mobile agents that have virtual sensors to “see” the world and move around with virtual “wheels.” The autonomous behavior is synthesized by the agent's internal dynamics, which evolve using a genetic algorithm. A purpose of synthetic psychology is to create a new concept in order to understand an essential psychological phenomenon. Therefore, the simulation framework has to use models sufficiently simple to analyze the behavior, but sufficiently complex to provide a theory to understand the psychological experiments.

As an example of synthetic psychology, we describe a simulation study of turn-taking using coupled dynamical recognizers. Studying turn-taking phenomena in robot experiments (e.g. Brooks et al., 1999; Dautenhahn, 1999; Steels and Kaplan, 2001; Miyake et al., in press) stresses the importance of embodiment and situatedness. In particular, MIT AI Lab's well-designed face robot, Kismet (Kismet project, 2000), can make use of human social protocols to stimulate natural emotions and social responses in humans. Even conversational turn-taking is established with a human subject. To do this, Kismet relies on subtle cues of human expression and interaction dynamics. Dautenhahn et al. used a mobile robot and a small humanoid robot to investigate the use of robotic toys in therapy and education of children with autism (Dautenhahn et al., 2002; AuRoRA project, 2005).

In order to demonstrate this effectively in the classroom, certain tools can be used, including simulation and real robots. Most instructors currently focus on simulation, as it requires significantly less investment of time, money, and maintenance—but to really understand the differences between simulation and reality, it is also necessary to work with the real platforms from time to time. To our knowledge, our course may be the only one in the world where individual students are consistently afforded the opportunity to work with a networked multi-robot system on a tabletop. The e-Puck, a low-cost small-scale mobile robotic platform designed for educational use, allows us bringing real robotic hardware into the classroom in numbers sufficient to demonstrate and teach swarm-robotic concepts.

The authors of this paper aim to describe the design of distributed architectures for the remote control of multirobot systems. A very good example of remote robot programming in order to validate these architectures is in fact the remote visual servoing control. It uses sequences of camera inputs in order to bring the robots to the desired position, in an iterative way. In fact, in this paper, we enabled the students and scientists in our university to experiment with their remote visual servoing algorithms through a remote real environment instead of using simulation tools.

Design/methodology/approach

Since 2001, the authors have been using the UJI‐TeleLab as a tool to allow students and scientists to program remotely several vision‐based network robots. During this period it has been learnt that multithread remote programming combined with a distributed multirobot architecture, as well as advanced multimedia user interfaces, are very convenient, flexible and profitable for the design of a Tele‐Laboratory. The distributed system architecture permits any external algorithm to have access to almost every feature of several network robots.

Findings

Presents the multirobot system architecture and its performance by programming two closed loop experiments using the Internet as communication media between the user algorithm and the remote robots (i.e. remote visual servoing). They show which conditions of Internet latencies and bandwidth are appropriate for the visual servoing loop. We must take into account that the real images are taken from the remote robot scenario and the experiment algorithm is executed from the client side at the user place. Moreover, the distributed multirobot architecture is validated by performing a multirobot programming example using two manipulators and a mobile robot.

Research limitations/implications

Future work will pursue the development of more sophisticated visual servoing loops using external cameras, pan/tilt and also stereo cameras. Indeed, the stereo cameras control introduces an interesting difficulty related to their synchronization during the loop, which introduces the need to implement Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) based camera monitoring. By using camera servers that support RTSP (e.g. Helix Producer, etc.) it means sending the differences between the frames instead of sending the whole frame information for every iteration.

Practical implications

The distributed multirobot architecture has been validated since 2003 within the education and training scenario. Students and researchers are able to use the system as a tool to rapidly implement complex algorithms in a simple manner. The distributed multirobot architecture is being applied as well within the industrial robotics area in order to program remotely two synchonized robots.

Originality/value

A significant improvement can be achieved using virtual reality training stations with lifelike visual, acoustic, tactile, and kinesthetic feedback. Particularly, when simulating procedures that require direct contact with the patient body, a realistic haptic simulation addressing tactile and kinesthetic senses can be essential for the acceptance of virtual simulation stations. A purely passive phantom may provide realistic haptic feedback, but its properties cannot be changed over time.

This paper presents the haptic display of the Munich Knee Joint Simulator, which was developed to improve training and education of physical knee joint examinations. The haptic interface comprises a combination of passive phantom segments providing realistic tactile sensations, and strong actuators generating highly dynamic kinesthetic force feedback. A 3 degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator was developed in this study to drive the thigh prosthesis and one 6 DOF industrial robot was used to actuate the shank prosthesis. Both manipulators are driven by hybrid admittance-impedance controllers capable of simulating the complex dynamics of the thigh and the shank. Both actuators are equipped with a 6 DOF force torque sensor and they are virtually coupled by an analytical knee joint model.

The development of MIP has the primary goals of project-centered innovations for technology transfer, training the regional workforce with relevance to industry, and sustainability of technology transfer through creation of high-technology jobs. The region known as Florida’s First Coast is one of the fastest growing in the nation and has received recent acclaim as a top location for new and emerging businesses and industries to relocate or expand. The importance of manufacturing to the economy is crucial. Every individual and industry depends on manufactured goods. This sector continues to account for 14% of US GDP and 11% of total US employment. One way to help expand the regional industrial base is to develop a shared resource support facility in the fields of manufacturing engineering and design. The first objective of MIP is to stimulate transformation of knowledge in design and manufacturing occurring in the academic domain to applied research and development in industry. This is accomplished with project-centered innovations developed using a shared manufacturing and design resource. The second objective of MIP is to develop partnerships with additional academic institutions with the common goal of producing students whose education satisfies the needs of the regional workforce with scientific and technological training with relevance to industry. This also includes a mentorship facet to attract and retain engineering students for the future. The third objective is to implement MIP for long-term sustainability of technology transfer and creation of high-technology jobs in the manufacturing engineering and design professions. Technology tools for innovation in advanced manufacturing, for example, robotics and automation, modular robotics, advanced manufacturing process development, manufacturing systems modeling, and simulation; and advanced design, for example, computer aided engineering including finite element modeling, design analysis, and rapid prototyping are used in support of projects in partnership with regional industrial companies. Joint industry-academic projects require the integration of research and the technical need of the partnering company. A critical level of innovation is accomplished with the outcomes of projects while providing a distinguishing educational background for the engineering graduates. Several partnership projects have been initiated under the auspices of MIP. These projects with local industry are outlined and serve as a platform for new and emerging projects for joint mutually beneficial collaboration between industry and academia.",,30

The complex interactions of agents in a team as well as with other agents make it extremely difficult for human developers to understand and analyze agent-team behavior. It has thus become increasingly important to develop tools that can help humans analyze, evaluate, and understand team behaviors. However, the problem of automated team analysis is largely unaddressed in previous work. In this article, we identify several key constraints faced by team analysts. Most fundamentally, multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. In addition, effective ways of presenting the analysis to humans is critical and the presentation techniques depend on the model being presented. Finally, analysis should be independent of underlying team architecture and implementation.

We also demonstrate an approach to addressing these constraints by building an automated team analyst called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis. ISAAC acquires multiple, heterogeneous team models via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. ISAAC also provides feedback on team improvement in two novel ways: (i) It supports principled “what-if” reasoning about possible agent improvements; (ii) It allows the user to compare different teams based on their patterns of interactions. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in two domains: (i) RoboCup Soccer; (ii) software agent teams participating in a simulated evacuation scenario. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup '99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup Scientific Challenge Award. In the evacuation domain, ISAAC was used to analyze patterns of message exchanges among software agents, illustrating the generality of ISAAC's techniques.

In fully implementing the Timed Default cc framework, jcc supports the notion of (typed) logical variables (called “promises”, after [5]), allows the programmer to add his/her own constraint system (an implementation of the Herbrand constraint system is provided), implements (instantaneous) defaults via backtracking, implements a complete renewal of the constraint-store at each time instant, and implements bounded-time execution of the Timed cc control constructs.

jcc implements the notion of reactive vats [5] as single threads of execution within the JVM; a vat may be thought of as encapsulating a single synchronous, reactive Timed cc computation. A computation typically consists of a dynamically changing collection of interacting vats (some of which could potentially be located at different JVMs), with dynamically changing connectivity.

jcc programs fully inter-operate with Java programs, and compile into standard JVM byte-code. jcc programs fully respect the Javatype system; logical variables are typed. jcc is compatible with the Generic Java [3] extensions, thereby allowing the use of parameterized types. Indeed, jcc may be viewed as an extension of Java which replaces Java’s notoriously difficult imperative thread-based concurrency with the notion of reactive vats interacting via constraints on logical variables.

In recent years, many of these communities installed fiber optic networks to supply the required broadband. Consequently, trenchless solutions were sought to provide economical construction methods that diminish disturbance to the community. HDD and in-sewer fiber installations provide economical trenchless solutions. The in-sewer fiber technology uses robots in no-man entry gravity sewers and drains to install fiber optic networks. University campuses share the same above characteristics of downtowns and business districts. The universities need to transfer high volume of data for education, research and development, and administrative activities. It is imperative that every classroom, lab, office, and dorm on the university campus has a fast Internet connection. Also many universities are converting to distance learning (teaching classes via the Internet). Economical and efficient communication between the universities and research institutions amplifies the return on the limited funds allocated for research and development. This study evaluates the hypothesis that trenchless installation of the fiber optic network is more beneficial than open cut installation on university campuses. In the last five years, many universities installed their fiber optic network using the open cut technique, which has caused numerous inconveniences to their campuses. Bowling Green State University (BGSU) just completed the Supernet project where BGSU replaced its old copper backbone and main rings with fiber optics cables. The study uses the BGSU campus as a guide to simulate an average size campus.

Second, users want database support for new applications which are sometimes far from the traditional database applications and introduce completely new requirements as well as the need to smoothly integrate database technology with other advanced technologies (e.g. neural nets) in one application. Finally, the embedding of databases into interactive work environments - for instance, the use of databases in cooperative environments (computer supported cooperative work) - forces the database community to reconsider some of the traditional beliefs about databases.

The Database Group at Hagen University has felt these application pressures in various projects for quite a time. As a consequence the emphasis of our research has shifted from database core technology to application oriented research. Where the former research projects were mainly centered around concurrency control, recovery, distribution, and other ""classical"" database topics, the new research projects are concerned with the support of design environments, where design includes all activities of developing complex artifacts and, in addition, usually involves the cooperation of a variety of people. Design here includes areas like mechanical CAD, software engineering, VLSI-design, multimedia production and many others. A characteristic of design in all these areas is the use of a variety of heterogeneous tools which leads to complicated interoperability and integration issues.

A key motivating factor in our work on design-environments is concurrent engineering which certainly is one of today's major industrial challenges. For computer science it opens new problems, and at the same time it requires integration of different fields. The above mentioned new requirements for databases apply in prominent ways, including the issues of managing complex data, interoperability and integration, and support of teamwork.

The second research area is distributed learning environments. We are working towards systems that in future will offer, in an integrated way, computer based training and multimedia learning material, access to all sorts of information bases, communication facilities, conferencing systems, and simulation, experimentation and exercising environments. Such systems are not only important for the changing needs of university education (first of all continuing education), but also for industrial education and training systems, especially in geographically decentralized organizations. While this work is not a primarily database centered one, databases play a key role as the repositories for distributed hypermedia information.

Part of our work in this second research area involves developing advanced teaching material for computer based learning in computer science, and in cooperation with other faculties, in areas like mathematics, humanities, economy, and history.

The Database Group in Hagen, including the computer based learning group, consists of about 20 scientists and technicians. About half of these are financed by research and development contracts. A special unit is concerned with technology transfer and database testing for certain types of applications. Closely connected to the Database Group is the <i>Institute for Automation, Production and Information Management.</i> This institute was founded by three different groups of Hagen University: an economics group with a special background in PPS, an automation group with the key area robotics, and our group. This institute acts as a platform for industry projects.

The research in the Hagen Database Group is not narrow focused but tries to address the multi-faceted problems of design and learning environments from different angles. The major projects are described in the following, together with the main members of the research teams. For each project, a small selection of publications is listed.",,30

These find application in entertainment, education, scientific visualization, ergonomic evaluation and as a medium for artistic expression. Two of the principal objectives which need to be addressed if human figure animation is to become more practical are the convenient, high level specification of movement sequences and the production of truly realistic movement. In order to provide convenient means of specifying movements there has been a tendency away from cell animation, where the user defines key positions in time, toward higher levels of control, where movements are specified as tasks like “walk to the door”. The computer “knows” about these tasks, decomposes them and calculates the proper joint angles over time. To attain a greater degree of motion realism techniques from robotics and biomechanics are being applied, where movements are generated through forces acting on masses of bodies.

This paper introduces a method to animate human locomotion based on these principles. A generic locomotion cycle is derived from a simple dynamic model. The forces and torques which control this model are internally generated from knowledge about human gait. The mechanical and robot-like appearance of the simulated motion is visually enhanced and humanized through kinematic algorithms; a human leg is superimposed onto the simplified dynamic pendulum leg, a pelvis is induced and the arm swing and shoulder rotation during locomotion are expressed as functions of the lower body movements.

The system which has been implemented can produce quite realistic looking human walks under a fairly wide range of conditions upon specification of only a few parameters, such as desired walking speed and step length. This will be extended in a straightforward way to running and locomotion over uneven terrain, up and down stairs, etc. Studies are also underway to determine how this approach can be applied to non-locomotory movement.",,30
