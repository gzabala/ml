NO,10.7227/IJEEE.49.3.5,An approach to motion control applications based on advanced programmable devices,"In this article a methodology for constructing a simple servo loop for motion control applications which is suitable for educational applications is presented. The entire hardware implementation is demonstrated, focusing on a microcontroller-based (μC) servo amplifier and a field programmable gate array-digital signal processor (FPGA-DSP) motion controller. A novel hybrid architecture-based digital stage is featured providing a low-cost servo drive and a high performance controller, which can be used as a basis for an industrial application. Communication between the computer and the controller is exploited in this project in order to perform a simultaneous adaptive servo tuning. The USB protocol has been put into operation in the user front-end because a high speed sampling frequency is required for the PC to acquire position feedback signals. A software interface is developed using educational software, enabling features not only limited to a motion profile but also the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) topology of the system. A classical proportionalintegral- derivative controller (PID) is programmed on a DSP in order to ensure a proper tracking of the reference at both low and high speeds in a d.c. motor. Furthermore, certain blocks are embedded on an FPGA. As a result, three of the most important technologies in signal processing are featured, permitting engineering students to understand several concepts covered in theoretical courses. © Manchester University Press.",ar,2012-01-01,International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Education,DSP | Educational software | Hardware description | Motion control | Real-time workshop,2-s2.0-84861023809,,,Article,Rodríguez-Reséndiz J.,60021143;60020052,West Virginia University;Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro,Morgantown;Queretaro,United States;Mexico,5,"Rodríguez-Reséndiz, Juvenal;Mendoza-Mondragón, Fortino;Gómez-Loenzo, Roberto A.;Martínez-Hernández, M.

NO,10.7227/IJEEE.49.3.6,Overcoming the challenges of porting OpenCV to TI's embedded ARM + DSP platforms,"The growing performance and decreasing price of embedded processors are opening many doors, for both developers in the industry and in academia. However, the complexities of these systems can create serious developmental bottlenecks. Sophisticated software packages such as OpenCV can assist in both the functional development and educational aspects of these otherwise complex applications; such tools lend themselves very well to use by the academic community, in particular in providing examples of algorithm implementation. However the task of migrating this software to embedded platforms poses its own challenges. This paper will review how to mitigate some of these issues, including C++ implementation, memory constraints, floating-point support, and opportunities to maximise performance using vendor-optimised libraries and integrated accelerators or co-processors. Finally, we will introduce a new effort by Texas Instruments to optimise vision systems by running OpenCV on the C6000™ digital signal processor architecture. Benchmarks will show the advantage of using the DSP by comparing the performance of a DSP+ARM® system-on-chip (SoC) processor against an ARM-only device. © Manchester University Press.",ar,2012-01-01,International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Education,ARM | DSP | Machine vision | OpenCV | Robotics,2-s2.0-84866429369,,,Article,Coombs J.,60015272,Texas Instruments,Dallas,United States,3,"Coombs, Joseph;Prabhu, Rahul;Peake, Greg",57213206118;55360632800;57200775417,60015272;60015272;60015272,July 2012,207209,17966,,Journal,49,3,,260-274,0,,undefined,,4,2012,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.7227/IJEEE.49.3.6,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1299/kikaic.78.2450,Development of in-situ robot motion modification method by hand-guiding instruction,"Future robotic systems intended to be used for domestic housekeeping or elderly care should flexibly adapt to the environment which is uncertain and may fluctuate. However, the current robot systems for industrial domain can operate only in the limited environment (well arranged and very little uncertainty) and require the special knowledge such as teaching-pendant and robot programming of the robot motion instructors. Obviously such requirements are not appropriate for home-use robots. This paper proposes a new method for in-situ robot motion modification by Hand-Guiding instruction. With the proposed method, a human demonstrator can intuitively modify the robot motion during its operation to adapt to environmental changes. Some daily domestic tasks are actually tried by using a lightweight pneumatic robot arm and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. ©2012 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.",ar,2012-01-01,"Nihon Kikai Gakkai Ronbunshu, C Hen/Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, Part C",Direct-Teaching | Human-Robot-Interaction | Planning | Pneumatic | Robot | Teaching-Pendant,2-s2.0-84864425216,,,Article,Tsusaka Y.,,,,,4,"Tsusaka, Yuko;Okazaki, Yasunao;Komatsu, Mayumi;Yokokohji, Yasuyoshi",55324588400;55325770500;55325574000;55957593800,;;;,2012,3875024,110132,,Journal,78,791,,2450-2461,1,,undefined,,0,2012,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kikaic/78/791/78_2450/_article/-char/ja/,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

Particular emphasis was placed on PWM techniques and theoretical signal generation using a MATLAB/Simulink environment and experimentally with a DSP programming kit. First, a model was developed in MATLAB/Simulink derived from electrical and mechanical equations for the 120° mode. The control strategies implemented involved two PWM techniques, namely soft and hard switching. The system was built in such a way that students are able to carry out modelling and confirm their results through the test bench using these techniques. The approach used has been effective in generating student satisfaction. Improvements in student learning are evident with regard to the drive control applications, either as a variable speed drive or in embedded systems. © Manchester University Press.",ar,2012-01-01,International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Education,Brushless d.c. motor | DSP | Electrical engineering education | Motor control | PWM Techniques,2-s2.0-84866359455,,,Article,Tadrist N.,60068750;60068746,Université Mouloud Mammeri de Tizi Ouzou;Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene,Tizi Ouzou;Algiers,Algeria;Algeria,3,"Tadrist, Nadia;Zeroug, Houcine;Boukais, Boussad",36449416300;6506962208;6507428232,60068746;60068746;60068750,July 2012,207209,17966,,Journal,49,3,,210-231,0,,undefined,,6,2012,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.7227/IJEEE.49.3.3,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1007/s10489-010-0257-9,A new approach to simultaneous localization and map building with implicit model learning using neuro evolutionary optimization,"This paper presents Neuro-Evolutionary Optimization SLAM (NeoSLAM) a novel approach to SLAM that uses a neural network (NN) to autonomously learn both a nonlinear motion model and the noise statistics of measurement data. The NN is trained using evolutionary optimization to learn the residual error of the motion model, which is then added to the odometry data to obtain the full motion model estimate. Stochastic optimization is used, to accommodate any kind of cost function. Prediction and correction are performed simultaneously within our neural framework, which implicitly integrates the motion and sensor models. An evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm is used to progressively refine the neural model until it generates a trajectory that is most consistent with the actual sensor measurements. During this learning process, NeoSLAM does not require any prior knowledge of motion or sensor models and shows consistently good performance regardless of the robot and the sensor noise type. Furthermore, NeoSLAM does not require the data association step at loop closing which is crucial in most other SLAM algorithms, but can still generate an accurate map. Experiments in various complex environments with widely-varying types of noise show that the learning capability of NeoSLAM ensures performance that is consistently less sensitive to noise and more accurate than that of other SLAM methods. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",ar,2012-01-01,Applied Intelligence,Evolutionary algorithm | Learning and evolution | Mobile robot | Motion model | Neural network | Sensor model | SLAM,2-s2.0-84863022806,,,Article,Kang J.G.,60032330,Pohang University of Science and Technology,Pohang,South Korea,4,"Kang, Jeong Gwan;Kim, Sunhyo;An, Su Yong;Oh, Se Young",35145928700;16024641100;55953711900;7404103488,60032330;60032330;60032330;60032330,January 2012,0924669X,23674,,Journal,36,1,,242-269,0,MKE,undefined,Ministry of Knowledge Economy,21,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10489-010-0257-9,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1007/s10846-011-9568-2,Path planning strategies for UAVS in 3D environments,"The graph-search algorithms developed between 60s and 80s were widely used in many fields, from robotics to video games. The A*algorithm shall be mentioned between some of the most important solutions explicitly oriented to motion-robotics, improving the logic of graph search with heuristic principles inside the loop. Nevertheless, one of the most important drawbacks of the A*algorithm resides in the heading constraints connected with the grid characteristics. Different solutions were developed in the last years to cope with this problem, based on post-processing algorithms or on improvements of the graph-search algorithm itself. A very important one is Theta that refines the graph search allowing to obtain paths with ""any"" heading. In the last two years, the Flight Mechanics Research Group of Politecnico di Torino studied and implemented different path planning algorithms. A Matlab based planning tool was developed, collecting four separate approaches: geometric predefined trajectories, manual waypoint definition, automatic waypoint distribution (i.e. optimizing camera payload capabilities) and a comprehensive A*-based algorithm used to generate paths, minimizing risk of collision with orographic obstacles. The tool named PCube exploits Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs) to assess the risk maps and it can be used to generate waypoint sequences for UAVs autopilots. In order to improve the A*-based algorithm, the solution is extended to tri-dimensional environments implementing a more effective graph search (based on Theta). In this paper the application of basic Thetato tri-dimensional path planning will be presented. Particularly, the algorithm is applied to orographic obstacles and in urban environments, to evaluate the solution for different kinds of obstacles. Finally, a comparison with the A*algorithm will be introduced as a metric of the algorithm performances. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",ar,2012-01-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,3D environments | A | Path planning | ThetaUAVs,2-s2.0-84855432288,,,Article,De Filippis L.,60012162,Politecnico di Torino,Turin,Italy,3,"De Filippis, Luca;Guglieri, Giorgio;Quagliotti, Fulvia",36612838300;6701332943;6603855231,60012162;60012162;60012162,January 2012,9210296,24360,15730409,Journal,65,1-4,,247-264,0,,undefined,Regione Piemonte,126,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10846-011-9568-2,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1007/s12369-012-0162-y,Learning of Planning Models for Dexterous Manipulation Based on Human Demonstrations,"In the human environment service robots have to be able to manipulate autonomously a large variety of objects in a workspace restricted by collisions with obstacles, self-collisions and task constraints. Planning enables the robot system to generalize predefined or learned manipulation knowledge to new environments. For dexterous manipulation tasks the manual definition of planning models is time-consuming and error-prone. In this work, planning models for dexterous tasks are learned based on multiple human demonstrations using a general feature space including automatically generated contact constraints, which are automatically relaxed to consider the correspondence problem. In order to execute the learned planning model with different objects, the contact location is transformed to given object geometry using morphing. The initial, overspecialized planning model is generalized using a previously described, parallelized optimization algorithm with the goal to find a maximal subset of task constraints, which admits a solution to a set of test problems. Experiments on two different, dexterous tasks show the applicability of the learning approach to dexterous manipulation tasks. © 2012 Springer Science & Business Media BV.",ar,2012-01-01,International Journal of Social Robotics,Machine learning | Motion planning | Programming by demonstration,2-s2.0-84868027343,,,Article,Jäkel R.,60102538;60084798,Karlsruher Institut für Technologie;FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik,Karlsruhe;Karlsruhe,Germany;Germany,6,"Jäkel, Rainer;Schmidt-Rohr, Sven R.;Rühl, Steffen W.;Kasper, Alexander;Xue, Zhixing;Dillmann, Rüdiger",23568193700;23568319800;35103462200;36337793500;24537821300;35599949300,60102538;60102538;60084798;60102538;60084798;60102538,November 2012,18754791,19500157063,18754805,Journal,4,4,,437-448,0,DFG,126239,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,13,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12369-012-0162-y,,Excluido por no educación

Robotics-based activities have been shown to encourage K-12 students to consider careers in computing and have even been adopted as part of core computer-science curriculum at a number of universities. Unfortunately, for students with visual impairments, there are still inadequate opportunities made available for teaching basic computing concepts using robotics-based curriculum. This outcome is generally due to the scarcity of accessible interfaces to educational robots and the unfamiliarity of teachers with alternative (e.g., nonvisual) teaching methods.

NO,10.18848/1835-9795/cgp/v04i01/40322,Analytical learning through robotics and the internet,"Learning computer programming or migrating to a new programming language is often perceived as being difficult. This is partially because the traditional methods of teaching focus more on the memorization of syntax rather than understanding and developing algorithms. Additionally, the traditional tools used to teach programming do little to retain students' attention or increase confidence in their skills. Building upon previous attempts at innovative computer programming strategies to create an environment that engages the student, this paper presents a method of learning programming through the use of robotics and the Internet. The concept revolves around separating language and function, focusing on the application of analytical thinking toward creating algorithms. The Internet is used to provide ubiquity in learning; creating an easily accessible platform that potentially reduces the cost of learning. This method can provide students with a greater understanding of the logic involved in programming than other approaches. This understanding should make it easier to develop unique/complex software or transition to a new programming language. The direction taken in this paper is governed by the notion that programming helps to develop analytical thinking.

NO,10.1109/TE.2012.2182998,A middleware platform for providing mobile and embedded computing instruction to software engineering students,"As embedded software systems have grown in number, complexity, and importance in the modern world, a corresponding need to teach computer science students how to effectively engineer such systems has arisen. Embedded software systems, such as those that control cell phones, aircraft, and medical equipment, are subject to requirements and constraints that are significantly different from those encountered in the standard desktop computing environment. For example, embedded systems must frequently address challenges that arise from severe resource restrictions (e.g., low memory and network bandwidth), heterogeneous hardware platforms, and safety-critical operations. Software architecture has been shown to be an effective means for coping with such issues, yet traditional courses on embedded software development rarely focus on software architectural abstractions. Instead, they have concentrated on lower-level issues such as programming languages and hardware interfaces. Since 2005 at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, a unique course has been developed that affords students the opportunity to gain experience and insights on developing software architectures for embedded systems. At the heart of the course is a middleware platform, Prism-MW, that helps students use software architectural principles to construct embedded systems and understand the important challenges of the embedded systems domain. This paper describes this course through the explanation and evaluation of four years of class projects, weaving together the course, the middleware platform, and the relationship of each to three key pedagogical goals that drove the formulation of the course curriculum. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",ar,2012-01-27,IEEE Transactions on Education,Glide | mobile computing education | Prism-MW | software architecture | software engineering,2-s2.0-84864646058,,,Article,Mattmann C.,60029311;60018319;60009037;112025537;100466028,University of Southern California;George Mason University;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;Blue Cell Software;Software Engineering,Los Angeles;Fairfax;Pasadena;Los Angeles;El Segundo,United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,5,"Mattmann, Chris A.;Medvidović, Nenad;Malek, Sam;Edwards, George;Banerjee, Somo",8969695400;7003876248;8969695500;7402316866;15922256600,60009037-60029311;60029311;60018319;112025537;100466028,2012,189359,17344,,Journal,55,3,6140611,425-435,0,NSF,CCR-9985441,National Science Foundation,3,2012,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6140611,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J6yivb0BqzeQVwIagsSZ4FHKZVju09oL/view?usp=sharing,"No parece mencionar una herramienta para programación de robots.

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2011.11.009,A two-tiered global path planning strategy for limited memory mobile robots,"Multi-robot systems have inherent advantages such as the ability to allocate and redistribute tasks across the team of robots. For multi-robot tasks such as exploration of large environments, some of the available robots may only possess simple embedded controllers with limited memory capacity. However, in some situations these limited robots may be required to perform global path planning to navigate beyond localised regions of the large environment. Global path planning can be problematic for the limited memory robots if they are unable to store the entire map in their local memory. Hence, this paper presents and evaluates a two-tiered path planning technique to permit global path planning. A set of local maps describing the global map is searched using a two-tiered A* algorithm that executes entirely on the limited memory robots.

NO,10.1109/TE.2011.2155066,Localization of mobile robots using an extended kalman filter in a lEGO NXT,"The inspiration for this paper comes from a successful experiment conducted with students in the Mobile Robots course in the fifth year of the integrated Master's program in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP), Porto, Portugal. One of the topics in this Mobile Robots course is Localization of Mobile Robots using the Extended Kalman Filter in a LEGO NXT, which gives the students the opportunity to study the concepts of localization. This experiment comes within the framework of teaching localization concepts in mobile robotics and focuses primarily on explaining the Kalman filter concept. It involves a specific tool developed by the authors and based on LEGO NXT technology. The work presented here could be a helpful guide for teaching concepts related to localization in mobile robotics to ensure adequate understanding of the concept and of the use of the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The LegoFeup robot described here was built using a LEGO Mindstorms NXT and tested both in simulation and in real scenarios. Based on the results obtained, the authors concluded that the developed tool is effective in motivating students. The implementation of the tool, the structure of the Mobile Robots course, and the criteria for student assessment are described in this paper. © 2011 IEEE.",ar,2012-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Education,robot kinematics | robot programming | robot sensing systems | Robots | state estimation,2-s2.0-84857030116,,,Article,Pinto M.,60007249,Universidade do Porto,Porto,Portugal,3,"Pinto, Miguel;Moreira, António Paulo;Matos, Anbal",35956813100;55971638300;7005323018,60007249;60007249;60007249,February 2012,189359,17344,,Journal,55,1,5782966,135-144,0,,undefined,,37,2012,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5782966,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAk4gVGrZRjHhyJY9AJjJ-23YDDFLkfD/view?usp=sharing,"La herramienta propuesta no parece servir para programar robots pero tal vez hacen una mención explícita al entorno de programación de LEGO mindstorms.

This is done by providing a handson educational tool that allows a change in the representation of abstract problems related to designing interactive parallel and distributed systems. Indeed, the MITS seems to bring a series of goals into education, such as parallel programming, distributedness, communication protocols, master dependency, software behavioral models, adaptive interactivity, feedback, connectivity, topology, island modeling, and user and multi-user interaction which can rarely be found in other tools. Finally, we introduce the system of modular interactive tiles as a tool for easy, fast, and flexible hands-on exploration of these issues, and through examples we show how to implement interactive parallel and distributed processing with different behavioral software models such as open loop, randomness-based, rule-based, user interaction-based, and AI- and ALife-based software. © 2012 International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB).",ar,2012-02-01,Artificial Life and Robotics,Distributed processing | Education | Modular robotics | Playware,2-s2.0-84857498771,,,Article,Pagliarini L.,60011373;112661944,Technical University of Denmark;Accademia di belli arti-Macerata,Lyngby;Macerata,Denmark;Italy,2,"Pagliarini, Luigi;Lund, Henrik Hautop",6602599847;7103197655,60011373-112661944;60011373,February 2012,14335298,144653,16147456,Journal,16,4,,441-447,0,,undefined,,1,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10015-011-0996-7,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.robot.2011.07.023,Coupled dynamical system based arm-hand grasping model for learning fast adaptation strategies,"Performing manipulation tasks interactively in real environments requires a high degree of accuracy and stability. At the same time, when one cannot assume a fully deterministic and static environment, one must endow the robot with the ability to react rapidly to sudden changes in the environment. These considerations make the task of reach and grasp difficult to deal with. We follow a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach to the problem and take inspiration from the way humans adapt their reach and grasp motions when perturbed. This is in sharp contrast to previous work in PbD that uses unperturbed motions for training the system and then applies perturbation solely during the testing phase. In this work, we record the kinematics of arm and fingers of human subjects during unperturbed and perturbed reach and grasp motions. In the perturbed demonstrations, the target's location is changed suddenly after the onset of the motion. Data show a strong coupling between the hand transport and finger motions. We hypothesize that this coupling enables the subject to seamlessly and rapidly adapt the finger motion in coordination with the hand posture. To endow our robot with this competence, we develop a coupled dynamical system based controller, whereby two dynamical systems driving the hand and finger motions are coupled. This offers a compact encoding for reach-to-grasp motions that ensures fast adaptation with zero latency for re-planning. We show in simulation and on the real iCub robot that this coupling ensures smooth and ""human-like"" motions. We demonstrate the performance of our model under spatial, temporal and grasp type perturbations which show that reaching the target with coordinated handarm motion is necessary for the success of the task. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

NO,10.1145/2133797.2133801,Learning to program with personal robots: Influences on student motivation,"One of the goals of using robots in introductory programming courses is to increase motivation among learners. There have been several types of robots that have been used extensively in the classroom to teach a variety of computer science concepts. A more recently introduced robot designed to teach programming to novice students is the Institute for Personal Robots in Education (IPRE) robot. The author chose to use this robot and study its motivational effects on non-computer science students in a CS0 course. The purpose of this study was to determine whether using the IPRE robots motivates students to learn programming in a CS0 course. After considering various motivational theories and instruments designed to measure motivation, the author used Keller's Instructional Materials Motivation Survey to measure four components of motivation: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. Additional items were added to the survey, including a set of open-ended questions. The results of this study indicate that the use of these robots had a positive influence on participants' attitudes towards learning to program in a CS0 course, but little or no effect on relevance, confidence, or satisfaction. Results also indicate that although gender and students interests may affect individual components of motivation, gender, technical self-perception, and interest in software development have no bearing on the overall motivational levels of students. © 2012 ACM 1946-6226/2012/03-ART4 $10.00.",ar,2012-03-01,ACM Transactions on Computing Education,Experimentation | Human Factors | Languages,2-s2.0-84859416463,,,Article,McGill M.M.,60003694,Bradley University,Peoria,United States,1,"McGill, Monica M.",34977353200,60003694,March 2012,19466226,19700183047,,Journal,12,1,4,,0,,undefined,,73,2012,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2133797.2133801,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xyPVEUzbaRIgFli6uPENm7YfhFRkPTdT/view?usp=sharing,"No parece mencionar una herramienta para programación de robots, pero puede ser útil para justificar la ""importancia del tema"" porque en las conclusiones mencionan los beneficios en la motivación de los alumnos

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2011.07.022,A 3D shape segmentation approach for robot grasping by parts,"Neuro-psychological findings have shown that human perception of objects is based on part decomposition. Most objects are made of multiple parts which are likely to be the entities actually involved in grasp affordances. Therefore, automatic object recognition and robot grasping should take advantage from 3D shape segmentation. This paper presents an approach toward planning robot grasps across similar objects by part correspondence. The novelty of the method lies in the topological decomposition of objects that enables high-level semantic grasp planning. In particular, given a 3D model of an object, the representation is initially segmented by computing its Reeb graph. Then, automatic object recognition and part annotation are performed by applying a shape retrieval algorithm. After the recognition phase, queries are accepted for planning grasps on individual parts of the object. Finally, a robot grasp planner is invoked for finding stable grasps on the selected part of the object. Grasps are evaluated according to a widely used quality measure. Experiments performed in a simulated environment on a reasonably large dataset show the potential of topological segmentation to highlight candidate parts suitable for grasping. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In domestic settings for service robots like in the RoboCup@Home competitions, complex tasks such as ""get the cup from the kitchen and bring it to the living room"" or ""find me this and that object in the apartment"" have to be accomplished. At these competitions the robots may only be instructed by natural language. As humans use qualitative concepts such as ""near"" or ""far"", the robot needs to cope with them, too. For our domestic robot, we use the robot programming and plan language Readylog, our variant of Golog. In previous work we extended the action language Golog, which was developed for the high-level control of agents and robots, with fuzzy set-based qualitative concepts. We now extend our framework to positional fuzzy fluents with an associated positional context called frames. With that and our underlying reasoning mechanism we can transform qualitative positional information from one context to another to account for changes in context such as the point of view or the scale. We demonstrate how qualitative positional fluents based on a fuzzy set semantics can be deployed in domestic domains and showcase how reasoning with these qualitative notions can seamlessly be applied to a fetch-and-carry task in a RoboCup@Home scenario. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",ar,2012-04-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,Domestic service robotics | Fuzzy sets | Golog | Qualitative spatial representation | Reasoning | Situation calculus,2-s2.0-84857790586,,,Article,Schiffer S.,60016653,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Aachen,Germany,3,"Schiffer, Stefan;Ferrein, Alexander;Lakemeyer, Gerhard",23096259200;8882768600;6603571701,60016653;60016653;60016653,April 2012,9210296,24360,15730409,Journal,66,1-2,,273-300,0,,SUA 07/031,Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,33,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10846-011-9606-0,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

Motion planning, logic-based planning and probabilistic mission planning are integrated into a single system and planning models are generated using Programming by [human] Demonstration (PbD). The strength of planning models arises from the flexibility they give the robot in dealing with changing scenes and highly varying sequences of events. This comes at the cost of complex planning model representations and generation, however. Manually engineering very general descriptions covering a large sets of challenges is infeasible as is learning them exclusively by robot self-exploration. Thus, we present PbD for planning models together with generation of parameters from analysis of geometric scene properties to tackle that difficulty.

NO,10.1007/s10710-011-9147-0,Learning local linear Jacobians for flexible and adaptive robot arm control,"Successful planning and control of robots strongly depends on the quality of kinematic models, which define mappings between configuration space (e.g. joint angles) and task space (e.g. Cartesian coordinates of the end effector). Often these models are predefined, in which case, for example, unforeseen bodily changes may result in unpredictable behavior. We are interested in a learning approach that can adapt to such changes-be they due to motor or sensory failures, or also due to the flexible extension of the robot body by, for example, the usage of tools. We focus on learning locally linear forward velocity kinematics models by means of the neuro-evolution approach XCSF. The algorithm learns self-supervised, executing movements autonomously by means of goal-babbling. It preserves actuator redundancies, which can be exploited during movement execution to fulfill current task constraints. For detailed evaluation purposes, we study the performance of XCSF when learning to control an anthropomorphic seven degrees of freedom arm in simulation. We show that XCSF can learn large forward velocity kinematic mappings autonomously and rather independently of the task space representation provided. The resulting mapping is highly suitable to resolve redundancies on the fly during inverse, goal-directed control. © The Author(s) 2011.",ar,2012-06-01,Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines,Actuator redundancy | Inverse problems | Learning classifier systems | Robot kinematics | XCSF,2-s2.0-84861095841,,,Article,Stalph P.,60017246,Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen,Tubingen,Germany,2,"Stalph, Patrick O.;Butz, Martin V.",25825607900;7003506369,60017246;60017246,June 2012,13892576,24208,,Journal,13,2,,137-157,1,DFG,BU1335/3-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,21,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10710-011-9147-0,,Excluido por no educación

The object placements should not only be stable but also be in their semantically preferred placing areas and orientations. This is challenging because an environment can have a large variety of objects and placing areas that may not have been seen by the robot before. In this paper, we propose a learning approach for placing multiple objects in different placing areas in a scene. Given point-clouds of the objects and the scene, we design appropriate features and use a graphical model to encode various properties, such as the stacking of objects, stability, object-area relationship and common placing constraints. The inference in our model is an integer linear program, which we solve efficiently via an linear programming relaxation. We extensively evaluate our approach on 98 objects from 16 categories being placed into 40 areas. Our robotic experiments show a success rate of 98% in placing known objects and 82% in placing new objects stably.

NO,10.1109/JOE.2012.2205638,COLA2: A control architecture for AUVs,"This paper presents a control architecture for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named the Component Oriented Layer-based Architecture for Autonomy (COLA2). The proposal implements a component-oriented layer-based control architecture structured in three layers: the reactive layer, the execution layer, and the mission layer. Concerning the reactive layer, to improve the vehicle primitives' adaptability to unknown changing environments, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been programmed. Starting from a learned-in-simulation policy, the RL-based primitive cableTracking has been trained to follow an underwater cable in a real experiment inside a water tank using the Ictineu AUV. The execution layer implements a discrete event system (DES) based on Petri nets (PNs). PNs have been used to safely model the primitives' execution flow by means of Petri net building block (PNBBs) that have been designed according to some reachability properties showing that it is possible to compose them preserving these qualities. The mission layer describes the mission phases using a high-level mission control language (MCL), which is automatically compiled into a PN. The MCL presents agreeable properties of simplicity and structured programming. MCL can be used to describe offline imperative missions or to describe planning operators, in charge of solving a particular phase of a mission. If planning operators are defined, an onboard planner will be able to sequence them to achieve the proposed goals. The whole architecture has been validated in a cable tracking mission divided in two main phases. First, the cableTracking primitive of the reactive layer has been trained to follow a cable in a water tank with the Ictineu AUV, one of the research platforms available in the Computer Vision and Robotics Group (VICOROB), University of Girona, Girona, Spain. Second, the whole architecture has been proved in a realistic simulation of a whole cable tracking mission. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",ar,2012-08-15,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,Mission programming | Petri nets (PNs) | Reinforcement learning (RL) | Robot control architectures | Underwater vehicles,2-s2.0-84867876487,,,Article,Palomeras N.,60009952,Universitat de Girona,Girona,Spain,4,"Palomeras, Narcis;El-Fakdi, Andres;Carreras, Marc;Ridao, Pere",55901120100;6506606659;7005596822;6603047256,60009952;60009952;60009952;60009952,2012,3649059,17277,,Journal,37,4,6263248,695-716,0,FP7,DPI2008-06548-C03-03,Seventh Framework Programme,59,2012,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6263248,,Excluido por no educación

Especially the detection of other players improves game play skills, such as obstacle avoidance and path planning. Such information can help refine reactive behavioral strategies, and is conducive to team play capabilities. Robot detection in the RoboCup Standard Platform League is particularly challenging as the Nao robots are limited in computing resources and their appearance is predominantly white in color like the field lines. This paper describes a vision-based multilevel approach which is integrated into the B-Human Software Framework and evaluated in terms of speed and accuracy. On the basis of color segmented images, a feed-forward neural network is trained to discriminate between robots and non-robots. The presented algorithm initially extracts image regions which potentially depict robots and prepares them for classification. Preparation comprises calculation of color histograms as well as linear interpolation in order to obtain network inputs of a specific size. After classification by the neural network, a position hypothesis is generated. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",ar,2012-09-10,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,2-s2.0-84865733668,,,Article,Metzler S.,60007493,Universität Bonn,Bonn,Germany,3,"Metzler, Saskia;Nieuwenhuisen, Matthias;Behnke, Sven",56684688300;36025747500;13007277900,60007493;60007493;60007493,2012,3029743,25674,16113349,Book Series,7416 LNCS,,,149-161,0,,undefined,,15,2012,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-32060-6_13,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2012.02.007,Task-oriented motion planning for multi-arm robotic systems,"In this paper a task-oriented motion planning approach for general cooperative multi-robot systems is proposed. In order to derive a meaningful task formulation, a taxonomy of cooperative multi-arm systems of industrial interest is devised. Then, a workpiece-oriented general formulation for cooperative tasks is proposed, where the user is asked to specify the motion of the system only at the workpiece level, while the motion of the single arms in the system is computed via kinematic transformations between the relevant coordinate frames. Based on this task formulation, an instructions set is derived to extend classical programming languages for industrial robots to general multi-robot systems. In order to test the approach, a software environment has been built, composed of an interpreter of the language and the motion planning software. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

NO,10.1007/s11370-012-0118-y,Caesar: An intelligent domestic service robot,"In this paper we present Caesar, an intelligent domestic service robot. In domestic settings for service robots complex tasks have to be accomplished. Those tasks benefit from deliberation, from robust action execution and from flexible methods for human-robot interaction that account for qualitative notions used in natural language as well as human fallibility. Our robot Caesar deploys AI techniques on several levels of its system architecture. On the low-level side, system modules for localization or navigation make, for instance, use of path-planning methods, heuristic search, and Bayesian filters. For face recognition and human-machine interaction, random trees and well-known methods from natural language processing are deployed. For deliberation, we use the robot programming and plan language Readylog, which was developed for the high-level control of agents and robots; it allows combining programming the behaviour using planning to find a course of action. Readylog is a variant of the robot programming language Golog. We extended Readylog to be able to cope with qualitative notions of space frequently used by humans, such as ""near"" and ""far"". This facilitates human-robot interaction by bridging the gap between human natural language and the numerical values needed by the robot. Further, we use Readylog to increase the flexible interpretation of human commands with decision-theoretic planning. We give an overview of the different methods deployed in Caesar and show the applicability of a system equipped with these AI techniques in domestic service robotics. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",ar,2012-10-01,Intelligent Service Robotics,Cognitive robotics | Decision-theoretic planning | Domestic service robotics | Fuzzy sets | Golog | Qualitative spatial representation | Reasoning | Situation calculus,2-s2.0-84867573740,,,Article,Schiffer S.,60033331;60016653,Fachhochschule Aachen;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Aachen;Aachen,Germany;Germany,3,"Schiffer, Stefan;Ferrein, Alexander;Lakemeyer, Gerhard",23096259200;8882768600;6603571701,60016653;60033331;60016653,October 2012,18612776,9500154152,18612784,Journal,5,4,,259-273,0,DFG,La 747/9-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,34,2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11370-012-0118-y,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.5772/50827,Combining vision learning and interaction for mobile robot path planning,"This paper addresses the question of how to make a robot learn natural terrain selectively and use the knowledge to estimate the terrain for planning an optimal path. A scheme which combines vision learning and interaction is proposed. The vision learning module employs an online boosting learning algorithm to constantly receive and learn the terrain samples each of which comprise the visual features extracted from the sub terrain region image and the traversability measured by the onboard Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU). Using this knowledge, the robot could estimate the new terrains and search for the optimal path to travel using the particle swarm optimization method. To overcome the shortcoming that the robot could not understand the intricate environment exactly, the vision interaction method, which complements the robot's capacity of terrain estimation with the human reasoning ability of path correction, is further applied. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 Bao et al.",ar,2012-10-04,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,Autonomous navigation | Mobile robot | Path planning | Vision interaction | Vision learning,2-s2.0-84868030296,,,Article,Bao J.,60007381;60005244,Yangzhou University;Southeast University,Yangzhou;Nanjing,China;China,3,"Bao, Jiatong;Tang, Hongru;Song, Aiguo",35168554500;13104029700;7102693451,60007381-60005244;60007381;60005244,4 October 2012,17298806,144749,17298814,Journal,9,,104,,1,,undefined,,5,2012,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5772/50827,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1080/01691864.2012.703167,Learning manipulation tasks from human demonstration and 3D shape segmentation,"According to neuro-psychology studies, 3D shape segmentation plays an important role in human perception of objects because when an object is perceived for grasping it is first parsed in its constituent parts. This capability is missing in current robot planning systems, which are therefore hindered in their ability to plan part-specific grasps suitable for the current task. In this paper, a novel approach for part-based grasping is presented that combines 3D shape segmentation, programing by human demonstration and manipulation planning. The central advantage over previous approaches is the use of a topological method for shape segmentation enabling both object categorization and robot grasping according to the affordances of an object. Manipulation tasks are demonstrated in a virtual reality environment using a data glove and a motion tracker, and the specific parts of the objects where grasping occurs are learned and encoded in the task description. Tasks are then planned and executed in a robot environment targeting semantically relevant parts for grasping. Planning in the robot environment can be generalized to objects that are similar to the ones used for task demonstration, i.e. objects that belong to the same category. Results obtained in 3D simulation confirm that the proposed approach finds with less effort grasps appropriate for the requested task. © 2012 Taylor & Francis and The Robotics Society of Japan.",ar,2012-11-01,Advanced Robotics,grasping | manipulation planning | programing by demonstration | shape segmentation | virtual reality,2-s2.0-84866405210,,,Article,Aleotti J.,60004969,Università di Parma,Parma,Italy,2,"Aleotti, Jacopo;Caselli, Stefano",23026542300;7004694361,60004969;60004969,1 November 2012,1691864,18003,15685535,Journal,26,16,,1863-1884,0,,undefined,,5,2012,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01691864.2012.703167,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1016/j.eswa.2012.04.038,Adaptability analysis of genetic network programming with reinforcement learning in dynamically changing environments,"Genetic network programming (GNP) has been proposed as one of the evolutionary algorithms and extended with reinforcement learning (GNP-RL). The combination of evolution and learning can efficiently evolve programs and the fitness improvement has been confirmed in the simulations of tileworld problems, elevator group supervisory control systems, stock trading models and wall following behavior of Khepera robot. However, its adaptability in testing environments, where the situations dynamically change, has not been analyzed in detail yet. In this paper, the adaptation mechanism in the testing environment is introduced and it is confirmed that GNP-RL can adapt to the environmental changes using a robot simulator WEBOTS, especially when unexperienced sensor troubles suddenly occur. The simulation results show that GNP-RL works well in the testing even if wrong sensor information is given because GNP-RL has a function to automatically change programs using alternative actions. In addition, the analysis on the effects of the parameters of GNP-RL is carried out in both training and testing simulations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

NO,10.1108/03684921311310594,Soft-computing based navigation approach for a bi-steerable mobile robot,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present an implementation of a soft-computing (SC) based navigation approach on a bi-steerable mobile robot, Robucar. This approach must provide Robucar with capability to acquire the obstacle avoidance, target localization, decision-making and action behaviors after learning and adaptation. This approach uses three neural networks (NN) and fuzzy logic (FL) controller to achieve the desired task. The NNs corresponding to the obstacle avoidance and target localization are trained using the back-propagation algorithm and the last one is based on the reinforcement learning paradigm while the FL controller uses the Mamdani search and match algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented, showing the effectiveness of the overall navigation control system. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, an interesting navigation approach is applied to a car-like robot, Robucar, with addition of an action behavior to deal with the generation of smooth motions. Indeed, this approach is based on four basic behaviors; three of them are fused under a neural paradigm using Gradient Back-Propagation (GBP) and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and the last behavior uses a FL controller. It uses a set of suggested rules to describe the control policy to achieve the action behavior. Findings: In the implemented SC-based navigation, the intelligent behaviors necessary to the navigation are acquired by learning using GBP algorithm and adaptation using FL. The proposed approach provides Robucar with more autonomy, intelligence and real-time processing capabilities. Indeed, the proposed NNs and FLC are able to remedy problems of analytical approaches, missing or incorrect environment knowledge and uncertainties which can lead to undesirable effects as the rough velocity changes. The simulation and experimental results display the ability of the proposed SC-based navigation approach to provide Robucar with capability to intelligently navigate in a priori unknown environment, illustrating the robustness and adaptation capabilities of the approach. Research limitations/implications: This work can be extended to consider mobile obstacles with a velocity higher than the velocity of the robot. Originality/value: This paper presents a learning approach to navigating a bi-steerable mobile robot in an unknown environment using GBP and RL paradigms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",ar,2013-01-01,Kybernetes,Autonomous mobile robots | Fuzzy logic | Navigation | Neural networks | Programming and algorithm theory | Robots | Soft-computing,2-s2.0-84874578555,,,Article,Azouaoui O.,60068734,Centre de Développement des Technologies Avancées,Algiers,Algeria,6,"Azouaoui, Ouahiba;Ouada, Noureddine;Mansour, Ibrahim;Semani, Ali;Aouana, Salim;Chabi, Djafer",17340147600;55613446600;35174910100;35175113800;55613389600;36551956500,60068734;60068734;60068734;60068734;60068734;60068734,February 2013,0368492X,12981,,Journal,42,2,,241-267,0,,undefined,,4,2013,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/03684921311310594/full/html,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

SI,10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.09.006,Collaborative gaming and competition for CS-STEM education using SPHERES Zero Robotics,"There is widespread investment of resources in the fields of Computer Science, Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (CS-STEM) education to improve STEM interests and skills. This paper addresses the goal of revolutionizing student education using collaborative gaming and competition, both in virtual simulation environments and on real hardware in space. The concept is demonstrated using the SPHERES Zero Robotics (ZR) Program which is a robotics programming competition. The robots are miniature satellites called SPHERES - an experimental test bed developed by the MIT SSL on the International Space Station (ISS) to test navigation, formation flight and control algorithms in microgravity. The participants compete to win a technically challenging game by programming their strategies into the SPHERES satellites, completely from a web browser. The programs are demonstrated in simulation, on ground hardware and then in a final competition when an astronaut runs the student software aboard the ISS. ZR had a pilot event in 2009 with 10 High School (HS) students, a nationwide pilot tournament in 2010 with over 200 HS students from 19 US states, a summer tournament in 2010 with ∼150 middle school students and an open-registration tournament in 2011 with over 1000 HS students from USA and Europe. The influence of collaboration was investigated by (1) building new web infrastructure and an Integrated Development Environment where intensive inter-participant collaboration is possible, (2) designing and programming a game to solve a relevant formation flight problem, collaborative in nature - and (3) structuring a tournament such that inter-team collaboration is mandated. This paper introduces the ZR web tools, assesses the educational value delivered by the program using space and games and evaluates the utility of collaborative gaming within this framework. There were three types of collaborations as variables - within matches (to achieve game objectives), inter-team alliances and unstructured communication on online forums. Simulation competition scores, website usage statistics and post-competition surveys are used to evaluate educational impact and the effect of collaboration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Third, we address the well-known what to imitate? problem from a different point of view, based on the mutual information between perceptions and actions. Lastly, the teacher's demonstrations are encoded using a Hidden Markov Model, and the robot execution phase is developed by implementing a modified version of Gaussian Mixture Regression that uses implicit temporal information from the probabilistic model, needed when tackling tasks with ambiguous perceptions. Experimental results show that the robot is able to learn and reproduce two different manipulation tasks, with a performance comparable to the teacher's one. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",ar,2013-01-01,Intelligent Service Robotics,GMR | Haptic perception | HMM | Imitation learning | Mutual information | Programming by demonstration | Robotic manipulation,2-s2.0-84872333655,,,Article,Rozo L.,60006754,Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas,Madrid,Spain,3,"Rozo, Leonel;Jiménez, Pablo;Torras, Carme",36603179000;7103171718;7003421114,60006754;60006754;60006754,January 2013,18612776,9500154152,18612784,Journal,6,1,,33-51,0,FP7,269959,Seventh Framework Programme,96,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11370-012-0128-9,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

In the first year, engineering undergraduates are introduced to a range of concepts from electrical, electronic and software engineering. They operate in an environment with different levels of interest, background knowledge and motivation. Thus it is essential to create a hands-on course unifying the concepts and demonstrating the application of the theoretical concepts taught in the lectures. This paper describes a first-hand experience of programming a microcontroller system to groups of first year undergraduate engineering students, which can be difficult unless a fun and engaging environment is provided. In this paper a first year teaching course is presented, taking students from introduction to graphical programming environment and microcontroller architecture to creating a programme using real sensors and actuators mounted on a robot, to perform a set of tasks. © Common Ground, Gordana Collier, Olga Duran, Andrzej Ordys, All Rights Reserved.",ar,2013-01-01,"International Journal of Technology, Knowledge and Society",Blended learning | Curricula developments for control and other engineers | Educational robotics | Educational technology | Electromechanical systems | Higher education | Learning in groups | Lego MindStorm NXT | Management of competences and knowledge | Mobile robots | Multidisciplinary learning | Problem based learning | Software engineering | Software tools | Student experience | Teaching and learning,2-s2.0-84888415230,,,Article,Collier G.,60033359,Kingston University,Kingston Upon Thames,United Kingdom,3,"Collier, Gordana;Duran, Olga;Ordys, Andrzej",54583355300;6603965669;6701592825,60033359;60033359;60033359,2013,,19900189254,18323669,Conference Proceeding,8,6,,121-129,0,,undefined,,4,2013,https://cgscholar.com/bookstore/works/technologycentred-teaching-methods-to-introduce-programming-and-robotic-concepts,ACAACA full text requested on research gate,

The concept of learning by demonstration is thus introduced, which may remove the load of detailed analysis and programming from the user. Following this concept, in this article, we propose a novel approach for the robot to deduce the intention of the demonstrator from the trajectories during task execution. We focus on the tool-handling task, which is common in the home environment, but complicated for analysis. The proposed approach does not predefine motions or put constraints on motion speed, while allowing the event order to be altered and allowing for the presence of redundant operations during the demonstration. We apply the concept of cross-validation to locate the portions of the trajectory that correspond to delicate and skillful maneuvering, and apply an algorithm based on dynamic programming previously developed to search for the most probable intention. In experiments, we applied the proposed approach for two different kinds of tasks, the pouring and coffee-making tasks, with the number of objects and their locations varied during demonstrations. To further investigate our method's scalability and generality, we also performed intensive analysis on the parameters involved in the tasks. © 2013 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.",ar,2013-01-01,"Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Transactions of the Chinese Institute of Engineers,Series A",Intention deduction | Learning by demonstration | Tool-handling task,2-s2.0-84878210399,,,Article,Chan H.Y.,60012370,National Chiao Tung University,Hsinchu,Taiwan,3,"Chan, Hoa Yu;Young, Kuu Young;Fu, Hsin Chia",36664180900;7402600823;7402947947,60012370;60012370;60012370,2013,2533839,15157,21587299,Journal,36,2,,190-201,0,NSC,NSC 96-2628-E-009-164-MY3,National Science Council,0,2013,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02533839.2012.730249,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1007/s10489-012-0339-y,Similarity measuring strategy of image patterns based on fuzzy entropy and energy variations in intelligent robot's manipulative task,"A similarity measuring strategy of image patterns based on fuzzy entropy and energy variations, using an intelligent robot's part macro-assembly (part-bringing) as an example, is presented. A part macro-assembly, locating various shaped assembly holes (targets) in a workspace corresponding to shapes of parts and then bringing a part to a corresponding target for the purpose of part mating despite existing obstalces, is introduced. This is accomplished by cooperating a neural network system with a fuzzy optimal control. Fuzzy entropy and energy functions, which are useful measures of variability and information in terms of uncertainty, are introduced to measure its overall performance of task execution related to the part-bringing task. An interrelation among learning, fuzzy entropy, and energy variations used as a measuring tool for a degree of similarity of image patterns is described. Through variations of fuzzy entropy and energy, a degree of similarity between input and desired output image patterns of neural network can be measured. The proposed technique is not only a useful tool to measure a degree of similarity between image patterns, but applicable to a wide range of robotic tasks including motion planning, manufacturing, maneuvering around workspace, and part mating with various shaped parts and targets. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",ar,2013-03-01,Applied Intelligence,"Fuzzy set theory | Image similarity measuring | Interrelation (learning, fuzzy entropy, energy variations) | Neural transmission energy",2-s2.0-84878499446,,,Article,Son C.,60002877,Dankook University,Seoul,South Korea,1,"Son, Changman",7005977310,60002877,March 2013,0924669X,23674,,Journal,38,2,,131-145,0,,undefined,,6,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10489-012-0339-y,,Excluido por no educación

In the last two years, various practical projects were assigned to students either as course projects or as capstone design projects in the area of control engineering using the National Instruments (NI) embedded robotic platform. The assigned projects focus on designing and equipping the robotic platform with environment-sensing (light, temperature and sound) capabilities, control operations for path planning and obstacle avoidance. Using the NI platform as a test bed for our teaching approach has resulted in the design and implementation of a successful prototype that enables students to experiment with various sensing, control and communication techniques on this platform, thus turning it into an intelligent mobile robot capable of implementing complex and computationally demanding control and estimation algorithms. Finally, the survey we conducted to assess the educational content, and value to students, of our proposed approach shows that our strategy has been so far fruitful and gives us ample encouragement to pursue it and develop it further. © Manchester University Press.",ar,2013-04-01,International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Education,embedded systems | FPGA | LabVIEW | mechatronics | mobile robots | project-based learning,2-s2.0-84882956902,F753PKJ236837523,,Article,Mysorewala M.,60009506,King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals,Dhahran,Saudi Arabia,2,"Mysorewala, Muhammad;Cheded, Lahouari",15623629000;6602769974,60009506;60009506,1 April 2013,207209,17966,20504578,Journal,50,2,,139-156,0,,undefined,,8,2013,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.7227/IJEEE.50.2.4,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gX2y1-eh11vfnhqPqHPpEwmwGJFRRroV/view?usp=sharing,"No parecen mencionar con mucho detalle la programación, y lo mismo no sé si cuenta como robótica educativa...

NO,10.1007/s10514-013-9324-5,A new paradigm for open robotics research and education with the C++ OOML,"For many years robotics has been benefited from the open source community. Software community projects like Player, Stage, Gazebo, ROS, or OpenCV are present in most robotic applications. In recent years this trend has also been initiated among electronic and mechanical developments (open hardware). The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it. Models could also be used for simulation, visualization, structural analysis, etc. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",ar,2013-04-01,Autonomous Robots,3D printers | Mechanical design | Object oriented programming | Open hardware | Open robotics | Open source | Software development,2-s2.0-84877876489,,,Article,Valero-Gómez A.,60028442;60001741,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid;Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Madrid;Madrid,Spain;Spain,3,"Valero-Gómez, Alberto;González-Gómez, Juan;Treviño, Rafael",54406165900;24922742900;55579180000,60001741;60001741;60028442,April 2013,9295593,18016,,Journal,34,3,,233-249,0,,undefined,,1,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-013-9324-5,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mwvVoUGoExJv7-16RTxPtqZs62f-y3MU/view?usp=sharing,"No parece que el lenguaje/librería/framework que proponen sirva para programar robots.

NO,10.1007/s10514-013-9323-6,ROS open-source audio recognizer: ROAR environmental sound detection tools for robot programming,"Advances in audio recognition have enabled the real-world success of a wide variety of interactive voice systems over the last two decades. More recently, these same techniques have shown promise in recognizing non-speech audio events. Sounds are ubiquitous in real-world manipulation, such as the click of a button, the crash of an object being knocked over, and the whine of activation from an electric power tool. Surprisingly, very few autonomous robots leverage audio feedback to improve their performance. Modern audio recognition techniques exist that are capable of learning and recognizing real-world sounds, but few implementations exist that are easily incorporated into modern robotic programming frameworks. This paper presents a new software library known as the ROS Open-source Audio Recognizer (ROAR). ROAR provides a complete set of end-to-end tools for online supervised learning of new audio events, feature extraction, automatic one-class Support Vector Machine model tuning, and real-time audio event detection. Through implementation on a Barrett WAM arm, we show that combining the contextual information of the manipulation action with a set of learned audio events yields significant improvements in robotic task-completion rates. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",ar,2013-04-01,Autonomous Robots,Audio event detection | Audio recognition | Robot manipulation,2-s2.0-84877874382,,,Article,Romano J.M.,60102562;113385150,School of Engineering and Applied Science;Rethink Robotics,Philadelphia;Boston,United States;United States,3,"Romano, Joseph M.;Brindza, Jordan P.;Kuchenbecker, Katherine J.",56856499800;7801469737;8349364500,113385150;60102562;60102562,April 2013,9295593,18016,,Journal,34,3,,207-215,0,Penn,W91CRB-10-C-0127,University of Pennsylvania,10,2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-013-9323-6,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1016/j.neunet.2012.09.015,Intrinsically motivated action-outcome learning and goal-based action recall: A system-level bio-constrained computational model,"Reinforcement (trial-and-error) learning in animals is driven by a multitude of processes. Most animals have evolved several sophisticated systems of 'extrinsic motivations' (EMs) that guide them to acquire behaviours allowing them to maintain their bodies, defend against threat, and reproduce. Animals have also evolved various systems of 'intrinsic motivations' (IMs) that allow them to acquire actions in the absence of extrinsic rewards. These actions are used later to pursue such rewards when they become available. Intrinsic motivations have been studied in Psychology for many decades and their biological substrates are now being elucidated by neuroscientists. In the last two decades, investigators in computational modelling, robotics and machine learning have proposed various mechanisms that capture certain aspects of IMs. However, we still lack models of IMs that attempt to integrate all key aspects of intrinsically motivated learning and behaviour while taking into account the relevant neurobiological constraints. This paper proposes a bio-constrained system-level model that contributes a major step towards this integration. The model focusses on three processes related to IMs and on the neural mechanisms underlying them: (a) the acquisition of action-outcome associations (internal models of the agent-environment interaction) driven by phasic dopamine signals caused by sudden, unexpected changes in the environment; (b) the transient focussing of visual gaze and actions on salient portions of the environment; (c) the subsequent recall of actions to pursue extrinsic rewards based on goal-directed reactivation of the representations of their outcomes. The tests of the model, including a series of selective lesions, show how the focussing processes lead to a faster learning of action-outcome associations, and how these associations can be recruited for accomplishing goal-directed behaviours. The model, together with the background knowledge reviewed in the paper, represents a framework that can be used to guide the design and interpretation of empirical experiments on IMs, and to computationally validate and further develop theories on them. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",ar,2013-05-01,Neural Networks,"Attention | Basal ganglia selection | Dopamine | Intrinsic motivations | Parietal, premotor, prefrontal cortex | Repetition bias | Striato-cortical loops | Superior colliculus | Trial-and-error learning",2-s2.0-84875892345,S0893608012002560,23098753,Article,Baldassarre G.,60012572;60001881,"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome;The University of Sheffield",Rome;Sheffield,Italy;United Kingdom,6,"Baldassarre, Gianluca;Mannella, Francesco;Fiore, Vincenzo G.;Redgrave, Peter;Gurney, Kevin;Mirolli, Marco",57196314496;16230850900;55734348904;7005371657;23766890200;6603860783,60012572;60012572;60012572;60001881;60001881;60012572,May 2013,8936080,24804,18792782,Journal,41,,,168-187,0,FP7,231722,Seventh Framework Programme,42,2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608012002560?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por machine learning

The experimental results have demonstrated that our method can perform the decision-making strategy and parameter setup optimization of ANN and GA by learning and can effectively escape from a trap of local minima, avoid motion deadlock status of humanoid soccer robotic agents, and reduce the oscillation of the planned trajectory among the multiple obstacles by crossover and mutation.

SI,10.1016/j.robot.2012.08.001,End-user programming architecture facilitates the uptake of robots in social therapies,"This paper proposes an architecture that makes programming of robot behavior of an arbitrary complexity possible for end-users and shows the technical solutions in a way that is easy to understand and generalize to different situations. It aims to facilitate the uptake and actual use of robot technologies in therapies for training social skills to autistic children. However, the framework is easy to generalize for an arbitrary human-robot interaction application, where users with no technical background need to program robots, i.e. in various assistive robotics applications. We identified the main needs of end-user programming of robots as a basic prerequisite for the uptake of robots in assistive applications. These are reusability, modularity, affordances for natural interaction and the ease of use. After reviewing the shortcomings of the existing architectures, we developed an initial architecture according to these principles and embedded it in a robot platform. Further, we used a co-creation process to develop and concretize the architecture to facilitate solutions and create affordances for robot specialists and therapists. Several pilot tests showed that different user groups, including therapists with general computer skills and adolescents with autism could make simple training or general behavioral scenarios within 1 h, by connecting existing behavioral blocks and by typing textual robot commands for fine-tuning the behaviors.

NO,10.1007/s00170-013-5034-6,Autonomous seam acquisition and tracking system for multi-pass welding based on vision sensor,"Automatic welding technology is a solution to increase welding productivity and improve welding quality, especially in thick plate welding. In order to obtain high-quality multi-pass welds, it is necessary to maintain a stable welding bead in each pass. In the multi-pass welding, it is difficult to obtain a stable weld bead by using a traditional teaching and playback arc welding robot. To overcome these traditional limitations, an automatic welding tracking system of arc welding robot is proposed for multi-pass welding. The developed system includes an image acquisition module, an image processing module, a tracking control unit, and their software interfaces. The vision sensor, which includes a CCD camera, is mounted on the welding torch. In order to minimize the inevitable misalignment between the center line of welding seam and the welding torch for each welding pass, a robust algorithm of welding image processing is proposed, which was proved to be suitable for the root pass, filling passes, and the cap passes.

The user interface system is designed to control the manipulator more easily in joint space, Cartesian space and tool frame. We use the skeleton data of the user from Kinect and Wrist-mounted IMU sensors to calculate the user's joint angles and wrist movement for robot control. The interface system proposed in this paper allows the user to teach the manipulator without a pre-programming process. This will improve the teaching time of the robot and eventually enable increased productivity.

NO,10.1109/TE.2013.2255877,Game-console-based projects for learning the computer input/output subsystem,"The input/output (I/O) subsystem is an important topic within computer architecture (CA) because it determines how the computer interacts with its environment. For this reason, computer scientists and engineers must understand how the computer manages this interaction, which is usually taught in introductory CA courses. Of course, there are many different styles of teaching, ranging from purely theoretical to completely practical. The CA course considered in this paper has already applied a practical approach for some time. For the I/O subsystem, students must be able to describe what polling and interrupts are and handle them through low-level programming. However, programming at this level in operating system (OS)-driven computers is not possible without being familiar with the kernel and drivers, which is not usually the case for students in an introductory course. Fortunately, there are many bare and specialized embedded systems around that are not OS-driven. In this proposal, the Nintendo DS (NDS) console was used in a classroom setting. It proved to be an appropriate infrastructure for developing attractive and engaging projects and was useful in providing a better understanding of the mechanisms related to the I/O subsystem. At the same time, the teaching methods were altered to make the transition from classical, passive, lecture-based classes to an active project-based learning (PBL) approach. It has been a very rewarding experience to see students learning to control the NDS devices on their own. In addition to describing the implementation of the proposed changes in two subsequent school years, this paper also presents some data and conclusions. © 2013 IEEE.",ar,2013-11-21,IEEE Transactions on Education,Computing education | game console | input/output (I/O) subsystem | Nintendo DS (NDS) | project-based learning (PBL),2-s2.0-84887778878,,,Article,Larraza-Mendiluze E.,60027856,Universidad del Pais Vasco,Leioa,Spain,8,"Larraza-Mendiluze, Edurne;Garay-Vitoria, Nestor;Martín, José I.;Muguerza, Javier;Ruiz-Vázquez, Txelo;Soraluze, Iratxe;Lukas, José F.;Santiago, Karlos",36195781200;14055862400;7501557829;6701605113;56921630600;23398524500;16203755000;16204092700,60027856;60027856;60027856;60027856;60027856;60027856;60027856;60027856,2013,189359,17344,,Journal,56,4,6502274,453-458,0,,undefined,,9,2013,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6502274,,Excluido por no robótica

We also investigated whether the lack of physicality in these environments impacts student learning by comparing classrooms that used either virtual or physical robots for the RVW curriculum.

Cognitive load theory (CLT) was applied to the instructional design of the workshops, and a controlled experiment was also conducted investigating aspects of the interface. Results indicated that a truncated interface led to better learning by novice programmers as measured by test performance by participants, as well as enhanced shifts in self-efficacy and lowered perception of difficulty. There was also a transfer effect to another programming environment (Alice). It is argued that the results indicate that for novice programmers, the mere presence on-screen of additional (redundant) entities acts as a form of tacit distraction, thus impeding learning.

NO,10.11120/ened.2013.00018,Teaching model predictive control algorithm using starter kit robot,"Advanced control concepts present a teaching challenge, where even at master level students benefit from these concepts being implemented and demonstrated on real hardware, rather than simply modelling the plant, applying control strategy and tuning. This paper describes one of a series of three experiments demonstrating the implementation of different control strategies using adaptive cruise control (ACC) on robot models and real robots. The experiment described here utilises the model predictive control (MPC) strategy implemented in ACC. The algorithm is realised using the graphical programming language (LabVIEW) as the design environment and National Instruments Robotics Starter Kit robot as the target hardware, with the code being deployed on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), included in the robot's architecture. Two robotic vehicles, 'the leader' and 'the follower' are programmed to execute ACC: the velocity of the leader robot and the distance between the robots are augmented into the robot's state-space equation, to design the controller (MPC), which was then tuned for both velocity and distance tracking modes. The experiment offers a novel idea on how to deliver this advanced control strategy in an applied and visual manner with laboratory experimentation supporting the theoretical aspects of learning. It brings to life some often stated theoretical qualities of an MPC controller, including quick rise time, minor fluctuation and a small distance tracking error, in line with current scientific papers. Thus, it demonstrates to students a clear correlation between theoretical expectations and real-life system performance whilst challenging their ability to work with real hardware. © 2013 J.

NO,10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2279535,Generalized Markov models for real-time modeling of continuous systems,"This paper presents a modeling framework based on finite-state space Markov chains (MCs) and fuzzy subsets to represent signals that vary in a continuous range. Our special attention to this extension of finite-state space MC modeling is motivated by numerous opportunities in applying MC models to represent physical variables in automotive and aerospace systems and, subsequently, using these models for fault detection, estimation, prediction, stochastic dynamic programming, and stochastic model predictive control. Our generalized MC modeling framework synergistically combines the notion of transition probabilities with information granulation based on fuzzy partitioning. As compared with the case of more familiar interval partitioning, the transition probabilities in our model are defined for transitions between fuzzy subsets rather than intervals/rectangular cells. Our framework is first introduced for scalar-valued signals and then extended to vector-valued signals. A real-time capable recursive algorithm for learning transition probabilities from measured signal data is derived. Formulas that characterize the possibility distribution of the next signal value and predict the next signal value are given. It is shown that the introduced modeling framework based on MC models defined over fuzzy partitioning inherits all properties and represents a natural extension of MC models defined over interval partitioning, while providing interpolation ability and improved prediction accuracy. In addition, we derive an alternative formulation of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation that applies to models in possibilistic/fuzzy environment. Examples are given to illustrate the key notions and results based on modeling of the vehicle speed and road grade signals. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",ar,2014-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,Automotive applications | fuzzy systems | granular computing | Markov models | possibility theory,2-s2.0-84905582683,,,Article,Filev D.,60029798;60025778,"Ford Motor Company;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Dearborn;Ann Arbor,United States;United States,2,"Filev, Dimitar P.;Kolmanovsky, Ilya",7004005522;7006937254,60029798;60025778,August 2014,10636706,24242,,Journal,22,4,6588289,983-998,0,,undefined,,40,2014,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6588289,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2014.04.005,Learning object deformation models for robot motion planning,"In this paper, we address the problem of robot navigation in environments with deformable objects. The aim is to include the costs of object deformations when planning the robot's motions and trade them off against the travel costs. We present our recently developed robotic system that is able to acquire deformation models of real objects. The robot determines the elasticity parameters by physical interaction with the object and by establishing a relation between the applied forces and the resulting surface deformations. The learned deformation models can then be used to perform physically realistic finite element simulations. This allows the planner to evaluate robot trajectories and to predict the costs of object deformations. Since finite element simulations are time-consuming, we furthermore present an approach to approximate object-specific deformation cost functions by means of Gaussian process regression. We present two real-world applications of our motion planner for a wheeled robot and a manipulation robot. As we demonstrate in real-world experiments, our system is able to estimate appropriate deformation parameters of real objects that can be used to predict future deformations. We show that our deformation cost approximation improves the efficiency of the planner by several orders of magnitude. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

NO,10.3389/fnbot.2014.00001,A psychology based approach for longitudinal development in cognitive robotics,"A major challenge in robotics is the ability to learn, from novel experiences, new behavior that is useful for achieving new goals and skills. Autonomous systems must be able to learn solely through the environment, thus ruling out a priori task knowledge, tuning, extensive training, or other forms of pre-programming. Learning must also be cumulative and incremental, as complex skills are built on top of primitive skills. Additionally, it must be driven by intrinsic motivation because formative experience is gained through autonomous activity, even in the absence of extrinsic goals or tasks. This paper presents an approach to these issues through robotic implementations inspired by the learning behavior of human infants. We describe an approach to developmental learning and present results from a demonstration of longitudinal development on an iCub humanoid robot. The results cover the rapid emergence of staged behavior, the role of constraints in development, the effect of bootstrapping between stages, and the use of a schema memory of experiential fragments in learning new skills. The context is a longitudinal experiment in which the robot advanced from uncontrolled motor babbling to skilled hand/eye integrated reaching and basic manipulation of objects. This approach offers promise for further fast and effective sensory-motor learning techniques for robotic learning. © 2014 Law, Shaw, Earland, Sheldon and Lee.",ar,2014-01-01,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,Constraints | Development | Intrinsic motivation | Robotics | Staged learning,2-s2.0-84904745003,,,Article,Law J.,60030514,Aberystwyth University,Aberystwyth,United Kingdom,5,"Law, J.;Shaw, P.;Earland, K.;Sheldon, M.;Lee, M.",36675177700;55267727500;56042000800;36615683200;55651378800,60030514;60030514;60030514;60030514;60030514,2014,,21100199837,16625218,Journal,8,JAN,Article 1,,1,FP7,231722,Seventh Framework Programme,23,2014,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2014.00001/full,,Excluido por nada que ver

Another objective was to gather knowledge in the mobile robotic area in order to provide practical solutions for industrial problems. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed new integrated platform would serve as didactic material for many disciplines, shown to be an ideal platform to teach DC motor drives, stepper motor and motion-control systems. To reach this objective, the ability of the robot to plan its motion autonomously is of vital importance. The control of a mobile robot in dynamic and unstructured environments typically requires efficient processing of data/information to ensure precise navigation and many other applications. Path planning is also one common method of auto-navigation. After the computation of the shortest path, mobile robot can navigate safely and without occlusion.

NO,10.3389/fnbot.2013.00025,Curiosity driven reinforcement learning for motion planning on humanoids,"Most previous work on artificial curiosity (AC) and intrinsic motivation focuses on basic concepts and theory. Experimental results are generally limited to toy scenarios, such as navigation in a simulated maze, or control of a simple mechanical system with one or two degrees of freedom. To study AC in a more realistic setting, we embody a curious agent in the complex iCub humanoid robot. Our novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework consists of a state-of-the-art, low-level, reactive control layer, which controls the iCub while respecting constraints, and a high-level curious agent, which explores the iCub's state-action space through information gain maximization, learning a world model from experience, controlling the actual iCub hardware in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever embodied, curious agent for real-time motion planning on a humanoid. We demonstrate that it can learn compact Markov models to represent large regions of the iCub's configuration space, and that the iCub explores intelligently, showing interest in its physical constraints as well as in objects it finds in its environment.",ar,2014-01-01,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,Artificial curiosity | Embodied AI | Humanoid | iCub | Intrinsic motivation | Reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-84995579611,,,Article,Frank M.,60101870;60014996;60006824,Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana;IDSIA Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence;Università della Svizzera italiana,Manno;Viganello;Lugano,Switzerland;Switzerland;Switzerland,5,"Frank, Mikhail;Leitner, Jurgen;Stollenga, Marijn;Forster, Alexander;Schmidhuber, Jurgen",55420607500;55330030700;55014232000;36518539600;7003514621,60014996-60006824-60101870;60014996-60006824-60101870;60014996-60006824-60101870;60014996-60006824-60101870;60014996-60006824-60101870,2014,,21100199837,16625218,Journal,7,JAN,25,,1,FP7,231722,Seventh Framework Programme,38,2014,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2013.00025/full,,Excluido por machine learning

Each point cloud is segmented into planar surfaces. Each subset of planes that represents an object is labelled and predicates describing those planes and their relationships are used for learning. Our claim is that a relational description for classes of 3D objects can be built for robust object categorisation in real robotic application. To test the hypothesis, labelled sets of planes from 3D point clouds gathered during the RoboCup Rescue Robot competition are used as positive and negative examples for an ILP system. The robustness of the results is evaluated by 10-fold cross validation. In addition, common household objects that have curved surfaces are used for evaluation and comparison against a well-known non-relational classifier. The results show that ILP can be successfully applied to recognise objects encountered by a robot especially in an urban search and rescue environment. © 2013 The Author(s).",ar,2014-01-01,Machine Learning,3D point cloud | Inductive logic programming | Machine learning | Object classification | Urban search and rescue,2-s2.0-84891371919,,,Article,Farid R.,60028333,UNSW Sydney,Sydney,Australia,2,"Farid, Reza;Sammut, Claude",55605558300;6701501948,60028333;60028333,January 2014,8856125,24775,15730565,Journal,94,1,,3-23,0,,undefined,,12,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-013-5352-9,,Excluido por machine learning

NO,10.1108/IJICC-05-2013-0028,Chaotic artificial bee colony approach to step planning of maintaining balance for quadruped robot,"Purpose: Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a relatively new optimization method inspired by the herd behavior of honey bees, which shows quite intelligence. The purpose of this paper is to propose an improved ABC optimization algorithm based on chaos theory for solving the push recovery problem of a quadruped robot, which can tune the controller parameters based on its search mechanism. ADAMS simulation environment is adopted to implement the proposed scheme for the quadruped robot. Design/methodology/approach: Maintaining balance is a rather complicated global optimum problem for a quadruped robot which is about seeking a foot contact point prevents itself from falling down. To ensure the stability of the intelligent robot control system, the intelligent optimization method is employed. The proposed chaotic artificial bee colony (CABC) algorithm is based on basic ABC, and a chaotic mechanism is used to help the algorithm to jump out of the local optimum as well as finding the optimal parameters. The implementation procedure of our proposed chaotic ABC approach is described in detail. Findings: The proposed CABC method is applied to a quadruped robot in ADAMS simulator. Using the CABC to implement, the quadruped robot can work smoothly under the interference. A comparison among the basic ABC and CABC is made. Experimental results verify a better trajectory tracking response can be achieved by the proposed CABC method after control parameters training. Practical implications: The proposed CABC algorithm can be easily applied to practice and can steer the robot during walking, which will considerably increase the autonomy of the robot. Originality/value: The proposed CABC approach is interesting for the optimization of a control scheme for quadruped robot. A parameter training methodology, using the presented intelligent algorithm is proposed to increase the learning capability. The experimental results verify the system stabilization, favorable performance and no chattering phenomena can be achieved by using the proposed CABC algorithm. And, the proposed CABC methodology can be easily extended to other applications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",ar,2014-01-01,International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics,Artificial bee colony (ABC) | Chaotic | Optimal control | Quadruped robot | Robotics | Step planning,2-s2.0-84902464144,,,Article,Luo Q.,60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,2,"Luo, Qinan;Duan, Haibin",57213472799;55796700200,60013789;60013789,June 2014,1756378X,19700182406,17563798,Journal,7,2,,175-191,0,,undefined,,4,2014,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJICC-05-2013-0028/full/html,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1007/s10514-013-9339-y,Socially guided intrinsic motivation for robot learning of motor skills,"This paper presents a technical approach to robot learning of motor skills which combines active intrinsically motivated learning with imitation learning. Our algorithmic architecture, called SGIM-D, allows efficient learning of high-dimensional continuous sensorimotor inverse models in robots, and in particular learns distributions of parameterised motor policies that solve a corresponding distribution of parameterised goals/tasks. This is made possible by the technical integration of imitation learning techniques within an algorithm for learning inverse models that relies on active goal babbling. After reviewing social learning and intrinsic motivation approaches to action learning, we describe the general framework of our algorithm, before detailing its architecture. In an experiment where a robot arm has to learn to use a flexible fishing line, we illustrate that SGIM-D efficiently combines the advantages of social learning and intrinsic motivation and benefits from human demonstration properties to learn how to produce varied outcomes in the environment, while developing more precise control policies in large spaces. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",ar,2014-03-01,Autonomous Robots,Active learning | Exploration | Imitation | Intrinsic motivation | Inverse model | Learning from demonstration | Motor skill learning | Programming by demonstration,2-s2.0-84894050292,,,Article,Nguyen S.M.,60013373,INRIA Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique,Le Chesnay,France,2,"Nguyen, Sao Mai;Oudeyer, Pierre Yves",54387384600;6507418132,60013373;60013373,March 2014,9295593,18016,,Journal,36,3,,273-294,0,FP7,240007,Seventh Framework Programme,37,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-013-9339-y,,Excluido por no educación

The intention is to build the foundation for a planning module within the Simultaneous User Learning and TAsk executioN (SULTAN) architecture, allowing a MAR to perform Daily Life Activities (DLA) in humanlike environments. Second, we apply AP techniques in fully observable, deterministic and static simulated environments with a single MAR. In addition, we analyze and compare the best available satisficing automated planners. The selected planners participate in several experiments to obtain plans for a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) based on the Tidybot domain.

NO,10.3390/s140916486,A remote lab for experiments with a team of mobile robots,"In this paper, a remote lab for experimenting with a team of mobile robots is presented. Robots are built with the LEGO Mindstorms technology and user-defined control laws can be directly coded in the Matlab programming language and validated on the real system. The lab is versatile enough to be used for both teaching and research purposes. Students can easily go through a number of predefined mobile robotics experiences without having to worry about robot hardware or low-level programming languages. More advanced experiments can also be carried out by uploading custom controllers. The capability to have full control of the vehicles, together with the possibility to define arbitrarily complex environments through the definition of virtual obstacles, makes the proposed facility well suited to quickly test and compare different control laws in a real-world scenario. Moreover, the user can simulate the presence of different types of exteroceptive sensors on board of the robots or a specific communication architecture among the agents, so that decentralized control strategies and motion coordination algorithms can be easily implemented and tested. A number of possible applications and real experiments are presented in order to illustrate the main features of the proposed mobile robotics remote lab.",ar,2014-09-04,Sensors (Switzerland),Control education | Mobile robotics | Multi-robot systems | Remote labs,2-s2.0-84907495205,,25192316,Article,Casini M.,60002838,Università degli Studi di Siena,Siena,Italy,4,"Casini, Marco;Garulli, Andrea;Giannitrapani, Antonio;Vicino, Antonio",7005650263;7003697493;6507678339;7006250298,60002838;60002838;60002838;60002838,4 September 2014,14248220,130124,,Journal,14,9,,16486-16507,1,,undefined,,22,2014,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/14/9/16486,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hPTVS4tYPkygw6DW_SIE-9u_IqkaYy5M/view?usp=sharing,"Interesante, puede ser útil para justificar el laboratorio remoto (posible futuro de mendieta).

These features are defined as centers and radiuses of circles that best fit to the curvature parts of the curvilinear path. In our previous research, we proposed a hierarchical layered paradigm for humanoid robot to learn how to walk in the curvilinear path. This model consists of four layers and each one has a specific purpose and is responsible to provide some feedbacks for the lower layer. In this study, we focus on the first layer which is high level decision unit responsible to provide some feedbacks and parameters for the lower layer using robot sensory inputs. The ultimate goal is that robot learn to walk in the curvilinear path and to reach this goal, the first step is to find robot position in the environment. In this work, Monte Carlo localization method is used for robot localization. Then we used artificial potential field to generate a path between robot and a goal. Finally, we proposed an algorithm that search the circles that best fit to the curvature parts of the path. Finding these features would help the learning process for lower layers in the learning model. We used robot camera as the only sensor to identify landmarks and obstacles for robot localization, path planning and finding curvilinear path features.",ar,2014-09-25,International Journal of Humanoid Robotics,Curvilinear path | Humanoid robot | Path planning | Robot localization | Robot vision,2-s2.0-84928238603,,,Article,Manoochehri H.E.,60024836,University of Isfahan,Isfahan,Iran,4,"Manoochehri, Hafez Eslami;Jamshidi, Kamal;Monadjemi, Amirhassan;Shahbazi, Hamed",55826212400;23667296200;14060806600;24923956200,60024836;60024836;60024836;60024836,25 September 2014,2198436,4700152208,,Journal,11,3,1450023,,0,,undefined,,1,2014,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219843614500236,,Excluido por no educación

Several universities commenced embedded-systems programming courses to complement students' skills by introducing specific firmware development techniques. Hands-on labs with real hardware interaction is restricted to the time students are in the laboratory whilst virtual-laboratories provide more flexibility at the caveat that students do not improve hardware manipulation skills as they cannot physically inter-actuate with real devices. We argue that students' abilities can be increased by providing them with a sensor board with reduced computation and communication capabilities to work with at home. Students increase the time spent manipulating the device; moreover, their motivation is also increased as they can put their effort on developments of their interest.

NO,10.1109/TAMD.2014.2359912,Learning from demonstration in robots using the shared circuits model,"Learning from demonstration presents an alternative method for programming robots for different nontrivial behaviors. Various techniques that address learning from demonstration in robots have been proposed but those do not scale up well. Thus there is a need to discover novel solutions to this problem. Given that the basic idea for such learning comes from nature in the form of imitation in few animals, it makes perfect sense to take advantage of the rigorous study of imitative learning available in relevant natural sciences. In this work a solution for robot learning from a relatively recent theory from natural sciences called the Shared Circuits Model, is sought. Shared Circuits Model theory is a comprehensive, multidiscipline representative theory. It is a modern synthesis that brings together different theories that explain imitation and other related social functions originating from various sciences. This paper attempts to import the shared circuits model to robotics for learning from demonstration. Specifically it: 1) expresses shared circuits model in a software design nomenclature; 2) heuristically extends the basic specification of Shared Circuits Model to implement a working imitative learning system; 3) applies the extended model on mobile robot navigation in a simulated indoor environment; and 4) attempts to validate the shared circuits model theory in the context of imitative learning.

NO,10.1177/0013164414520629,Learning Computerese: The Role of Second Language Learning Aptitude in Technology Acceptance,"This article introduces a new construct coined as Computer User Learning Aptitude (CULA). To establish construct validity, CULA is embedded in a nomological network that extends the technology acceptance model (TAM). Specifically, CULA is posited to affect perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, the two underlying TAM constructs. Furthermore, we examine several antecedents of CULA by relying on the second language learning literature. These include computer anxiety, tolerance of ambiguity, and risk taking. Conceptualization of CULA is based on the observation that computer systems use language as communication between the computer and the user, making system usage significantly dependent on the ability of the individual to learn the language. We posit that learning to communicate with computer technology is akin to learning a second language, that is, a language learned after the first language(s) or native language(s), and is referred to as computerese. The proposed construct, CULA, measures the aptitude of an individual to learn computerese, and it is specified as a second-order variable. It includes measures of three critical facets of computerese pertaining to general hardware/software, programming, and the Internet. Significant relationships are found between computer anxiety, tolerance of ambiguity, and taking risk with CULA, as well as between CULA and TAM constructs.",ar,2014-12-24,Educational and Psychological Measurement,computer anxiety | computer user learning aptitude | perceived ease of use | perceived usefulness | second language learning | tolerance of ambiguity,2-s2.0-84911446431,,,Article,Warner J.A.,60025157;60020547,Sam Houston State University;Texas A&amp;M University,Huntsville;College Station,United States;United States,3,"Warner, Janis A.;Koufteros, Xenophon;Verghese, Anto",57035543400;6701430508;55803661800,60025157;60020547;60020547,24 December 2014,131644,13563,15523888,Journal,74,6,,991-1017,0,,undefined,,6,2014,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013164414520629,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

NO,10.1007/978-3-319-15847-1_32,The social construction of creativity in educational robotics,"One of the main benefits of educational robotics is its potential to inspire curiosity and creativity in students. Creativity in educational robotics has been typically associated with the constructionist learning paradigm and the processes of building, programming and manipulating task-centric robotic platforms. On the other hand, there has been a growing tendency recently to use anthropomorphic social robots in education that act not only as tools but also as peers and teaching assistants. Since the role of anthropomorphic social robots is to engage as social actors, designing and manipulating robots as a form of creation is no longer a goal for educational robotics. This paper argues that a new form of creativity concerns the meanings students make of anthropomorphic robots in the course of human-robot social interaction. This is based on the following assumptions: creativity is socially constructed and the main reason for students to be interested in robotics is a fascination with the illusion of life. In particular, this paper proposes to encourage the ability to create meanings through exploration of a mismatch between humanlike robot design and the human frame of reference.",ar,2015-01-01,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Anthropomorphism | Creativity | Educational robots | Meaning-making | Social robotics,2-s2.0-84924706339,,,Article,Zawieska K.,60005141;108888803,University College Dublin;Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements PIAP,Dublin;,Ireland;Poland,2,"Zawieska, Karolina;Duffy, Brian R.",55515563700;7103040482,108888803-60005141;60005141,2015,21945357,5100152904,,Book Series,351,,,329-338,0,,undefined,,26,2015,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-15847-1_32,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlHkB1dSmhBdtq-NASbTI-kBBePsaAcl/view?usp=sharing,"Revisar... no parece que hablen mucho de programación.

We don't understand completely the causes but it has become clear that men and women have different perceptions of programming. The pedagogy of introductory programming courses should take these differences into account. In this study we analyze gender differences in an introductory programming course at the university level. Our results indicate that male and female students have different perceptions and learning outcomes: male students find programming easier, have a higher intention to program in the future and show higher learning outcomes than female students. To reduce these differences we have designed and implemented several learning modules using the principles of physical computing. The physical computing approach aims to take computational concepts out of the screen and into the real world so that students can interact with them. We have applied these modules in a MATLAB introductory programming course in a biology degree. When using these modules both male and female students showed similar results in perceptions and learning outcomes.

Both subsystems are parts of an innovative system, namely the PROTEAS kit. The tangible subsystem consists of cube-shaped blocks that represent simple and more advanced programming structures. Users may interconnect the cubic-shaped commands and so create the robot programming code. The graphical subsystem presents onscreen an isomorphic to the tangible programming space. Children (N = 109) of five different aged groups were let to interact in pairs with the two operationally equivalent programming subsystems with the scope to program a NXT Lego robot. Three variables associated with children performance upon tasks and four variables related with performance during free interaction were studied. Data analysis based on computer logs and video recordings showed that children produced fewer errors, made more effective debugging and younger children in particular needed less time to accomplish the robot programming tasks with the tangible subsystem. Moreover, during free interaction, elder children were more engaged, created more complicated programs and explored different commands and parameters more actively in the tangible case.

NO,10.1016/j.asoc.2014.09.021,Learning fuzzy controllers in mobile robotics with embedded preprocessing,"The automatic design of controllers for mobile robots usually requires two stages. In the first stage, sensorial data are preprocessed or transformed into high level and meaningful values of variables which are usually defined from expert knowledge. In the second stage, a machine learning technique is applied to obtain a controller that maps these high level variables to the control commands that are actually sent to the robot. This paper describes an algorithm that is able to embed the preprocessing stage into the learning stage in order to get controllers directly starting from sensorial raw data with no expert knowledge involved. Due to the high dimensionality of the sensorial data, this approach uses Quantified Fuzzy Rules (QFRs), that are able to transform low-level input variables into high-level input variables, reducing the dimensionality through summarization. The proposed learning algorithm, called Iterative Quantified Fuzzy Rule Learning (IQFRL), is based on genetic programming. IQFRL is able to learn rules with different structures, and can manage linguistic variables with multiple granularities. The algorithm has been tested with the implementation of the wall-following behavior both in several realistic simulated environments with different complexity and on a Pioneer 3-AT robot in two real environments. Results have been compared with several well-known learning algorithms combined with different data preprocessing techniques, showing that IQFRL exhibits a better and statistically significant performance. Moreover, three real world applications for which IQFRL plays a central role are also presented: path and object tracking with static and moving obstacles avoidance.",ar,2015-01-01,Applied Soft Computing Journal,Genetic fuzzy system | Iterative rule learning | Mobile robotics | Quantified fuzzy rules,2-s2.0-84908428493,S1568494614004748,,Article,Rodríguez-Fdez I.,60028419,Universidad de Santiago de Compostela,Santiago de Compostela,Spain,3,"Rodríguez-Fdez, I.;Mucientes, M.;Bugarín, A.",46161519200;6506530208;55910844200,60028419;60028419;60028419,January 2015,15684946,18136,,Journal,26,,,123-142,0,,undefined,,10,2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494614004748?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

The calibration force sensors were mounted at the root of each finger, and the force signals were obtained by the force sensors. The expected force, position and speed parameters of the fingers can be set separately, so the grip centre and stroke can be controlled for the finger by pre-programming, the movement and forces of grasped objects can be actively controlled to achieve through the two-finger operations. The gripper with both the mechanical mechanism and control flexibility was mounted in the end of the industrial robot. The grasping experiment platform composed of industrial robot and dexterous gripper integrated monocular vision, force sensing and many kinds of sensors. The 2-D vision was able to quickly detect and locate grasped objects at the top of the experiment platform. Second, a force impedance control algorithm was proposed and used for one of fingers, position control was used for another finger, and it can regulate the grasping force by deﬁning the target impedance between desired position and contact force. The whole grasping system can be equivalent to impedance & admittance model, and the finger force/position control can be equivalent to the expected target inertia-damping-stiffness model, and the model parameters can be adjustable according to the needs to realize the dynamic relationship between grasping force and position. The contact force errors between expected force value and actual force acquired from the force sensor were as the input of impedance controller and its output can be realized by the reference trajectory correction to the internal position control loop. The proposed algorithm only considered the direction of gripping fruit and vegetable, and the reference trajectory can be determined simply, and then avoids the use of complicated impedance control for multi-degree of freedom manipulators, through which it can improve the real-time control and robustness of the grasping system with model uncertainty or external force disturbance. Robot grasping experiments show that the system runs smoothly and reliably, the force-feedback impedance control is very effective, and the steady state error is maximum range within ± 0.4N in the experiment of grasping the tomatoes and eggs. It can make force track value with small force overshot and fast response simultaneously between the end-effector and fruit and vegetable, so it makes the force controller adaptive to the dynamic grasp process between the end-effector and fruit and vegetable, it can realize the flexible grasping and reduce damages and ensure the quality of the grasped fruit and vegetable. The research provides a key control technology for the compliant grasping of fruit and vegetable.",ar,2015-01-01,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,Admittance control | Algorithms | End effectors | Flexible grasping | Force control | Impedance control | Picking | Robots,2-s2.0-84923788173,,,Article,Wang X.,60011592;60004148,Qilu University of Technology;Jiangxi Agricultural University,Jinan;Nanchang,China;China,5,"Wang, Xuelin;Xiao, Yongfei;Bi, Shuhui;Fan, Xinjian;Rao, Honghui",57196445872;24479963600;24922887500;52163427500;16304896700,60011592;60011592;60011592;60011592;60004148,1 January 2015,10026819,62499,,Journal,31,1,,58-63,0,,undefined,,25,2015,https://doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.1002-6819.2015.01.009,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2014.08.013,On-line knowledge acquisition and enhancement in robotic assembly tasks,"Industrial robots are reliable machines for manufacturing tasks such as welding, panting, assembly, palletizing or kitting operations. They are traditionally programmed by an operator using a teach pendant in a point-to-point scheme with limited sensing capabilities such as industrial vision systems and force/torque sensing. The use of these sensing capabilities is associated to the particular robot controller, operative systems and programming language. Today, robots can react to environment changes speci fic to their task domain but are still unable to learn skills to effectively use their current knowledge. The need for such a skill in unstructured environments where knowledge can be acquired and enhanced is desirable so that robots can effectively interact in multimodal real-world scenarios. In this article we present a multimodal assembly controller (MAC) approach to embed and effectively enhance knowledge into industrial robots working in multimodal manufacturing scenarios such as assembly during kitting operations with varying shapes and tolerances. During learning, the robot uses its vision and force capabilities resembling a human operator carrying out the same operation. The approach consists of using a MAC based on the Fuzzy ARTMAP artificial neural network in conjunction with a knowledge base. The robot starts the operation having limited initial knowledge about what task it has to accomplish. During the operation, the robot learns the skill for recognising assembly parts and how to assemble them. The skill acquisition is evaluated by counting the steps to complete the assembly, length of the followed assembly path and compliant behaviour. The performance improves with time so that the robot becomes an expert demonstrated by the assembly of a kit with different part geometries. The kit is unknown by the robot at the beginning of the operation; therefore, the kit type, location and orientation are unknown as well as the parts to be assembled since they are randomly fed by a conveyor belt.",ar,2015-01-01,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,Artificial neural networks | Kitting process | Machine vision | Robotic assembly,2-s2.0-85027945436,S073658451400074X,,Article,Navarro-Gonzalez J.L.,114774507,Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav),Saltillo,Mexico,4,"Navarro-Gonzalez, J.

The objective of EOS courses is to develop students' ability to port, modify, and customize an embedded operating system through a series of laboratory exercises. However, our teaching experience has revealed that beginners require a considerable amount of time to familiarize themselves with the development environment and the relevant processes, such as operating in a command line interface, setting environment variables, and kernel configurations. Furthermore, students need to constantly handle compiler error messages, malfunctions of the target EOS, and incompatibility issues related to development tools. These problems may frustrate and discourage students. A common strategy to address this problem is to dedicate more hours to teaching or to hire more teaching assistants to help students progress. However, none of these methods is suitable for institutions with limited resources. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a computer-assisted learning system called the Computer-assisted Learning Environment (CALEE) to assist students with their assignments and thus motivate them. CALEE consists of two parts: a self-learning assistant (SLAT) and a collaborative learning website (CLW). SLAT is a software application that provides a set of useful functions to help students perform EOS laboratory exercises, whereas the collaborative learning website seeks to encourage greater interaction among students.

NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2014.08.012,"Design, programming and orchestration of heterogeneous manufacturing systems through VR-powered remote collaboration","Modern manufacturing systems are often composed of a variety of highly customized units and specifically designed manufacturing cells. Optimization of assembly and training of staff requires a series of demo installations and excessive use of costly operational resources. In some cases, components are located at different sites, making the orchestration of the whole system even more difficult. Virtual Reality (VR) collaboration environments offer a solution by enabling high fidelity testing and training of complex manufacturing systems. On the other hand, such platforms are difficult to implement in an engineering perspective, as they are required to provide reliable, standard interfaces towards both robotic components and human operators.

VirCA offers functions for the high-level interoperability of heterogeneous components in a wide range of domains, spanning from research & development, through remote education to orchestration and management of industrial processes in manufacturing applications.

NO,10.1145/2699697,aToucan: An automated framework to derive UML analysis models from use case models,"The transition from an informal requirements specification in natural language to a structured, precise specification is an important challenge in practice. It is particularly so for object-oriented methods, defined in the context of the OMG's Model Driven Architecture (MDA), where a key step is to transition from a use case model to an analysis model. However, providing automated support for this transition is challenging, mostly because, in practice, requirements are expressed in natural language and are much less structured than other kinds of development artifacts. Such an automated transformation would enable at least the generation of an initial, likely incomplete, analysis model and enable automated traceability from requirements to code, through various intermediate models. In this article, we propose a method and a tool called aToucan, building on existing work, to automatically generate a UML analysis model comprising class, sequence and activity diagrams from a use case model and to automatically establish traceability links between model elements of the use case model and the generated analysis model. Note that our goal is to save effort through automated support, not to replace human abstraction and decision making.

Seven (six) case studies were performed to compare class (sequence) diagrams generated by aToucan to the ones created by experts, Masters students, and trained, fourth-year undergraduate students. Results show that aToucan performs well regarding consistency (e.g., 88% class diagram consistency) and completeness (e.g., 80% class completeness) when comparing generated class diagrams with reference class diagrams created by experts and Masters students. Similarly, sequence diagrams automatically generated by aToucan are highly consistent with the ones devised by experts and are also rather complete, for instance, 91% and 97% message consistency and completeness, respectively. Further, statistical tests show that aToucan significantly outperforms fourth-year engineering students in this respect, thus demonstrating the value of automation. We also conducted two industrial case studies demonstrating the applicability of aToucan in two different industrial domains. Results showed that the vast majority of model elements generated by aToucan are correct and that therefore, in practice, such models would be good initial models to refine and augment so as to converge towards to correct and complete analysis models. A performance analysis shows that the execution time of aToucan (when generating class and sequence diagrams) is dependent on the number of simple sentences contained in the use case model and remains within a range of a few minutes. Five different software system descriptions (18 use cases altogether) were performed to evaluate the generation of activity diagrams. Results show that aToucan can generate 100% complete and correct control flow information of activity diagrams and on average 85% data flAow information completeness. Moreover, we show that aToucan outperforms three commercial tools in terms of activity diagram generation.",ar,2015-01-01,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,,2-s2.0-84930158786,,,Article,Yue T.,,Universitetet i Oslo,Oslo,Norway,,,,,1 May 2015,1049331X,18121,15577392,Journal,24,3,13,,0,,,,58,2015,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2699697,,Excluido por nada que ver (UML)
NO,10.1109/TE.2014.2318678,ReAct!: An interactive educational tool for AI planning for robotics,"This paper presents ReAct!, an interactive educational tool for artificial intelligence (AI) planning for robotics. ReAct! enables students to describe robots' actions and change in dynamic domains without first having to know about the syntactic and semantic details of the underlying formalism, and to solve planning problems using state-of-the-art reasoners without having to know about their input/output language or usage. In particular, ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. ReAct! also allows the embedding of externally defined calculations (e.g., checking for collision-free continuous trajectories) into domain representations of hybrid domains that require a tight integration of (discrete) high-level reasoning with (continuous) geometric reasoning. ReAct! also allows students to solve planning problems that involve complex temporal goals. This broad applicability, and the intelligent interactive user interface, mean that students can work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive factories, leading to hands-on robotic applications. The efficacy of ReAct! was evaluated from three different points of view: 1) the course outcomes that demonstrate its utility in achieving the learning objectives of a research-oriented cognitive robotics course; 2) the user friendliness and usefulness of ReAct! for students, as evaluated by quantitative student surveys; and 3) instructors' experience of teaching the course either with or without ReAct!.",ar,2015-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Education,Artificial intelligence (AI) planning | automated reasoning | hybrid planning | knowledge representation | robotics,2-s2.0-85027956616,,,Article,Dogmus Z.,60008991,Sabancı Üniversitesi,Tuzla,Turkey,3,"Dogmus, Zeynep;Erdem, Esra;Patoglu, Volkan",55293691700;36847843900;19640643500,60008991;60008991;60008991,1 February 2015,189359,17344,,Journal,58,1,6807834,15-24,0,,undefined,,15,2015,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6807834,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t5c7PGRiice2D9bEsMqeXZk_IIB56aID/view?usp=sharing,"El enfoque parece ser IA pero igual revisar porque puede ser que permita la programación de robots con un muy alto nivel de abstracción o algo así... no estoy seguro

Then, in order to improve the poor convergence performance of the geometrical learning planning algorithm when the robot gets close to the target, the random select point method is modified by considering the target as the first selected point when the target appears in the detected area.

However, traditional path planning techniques optimize the navigation path solely based on the models of the robot and the environments. Owing to the time-varying environment, the robot is expected to launch the replanning procedure in real-time continuously. It is slow and wastes computing resources for repeated decisions. In this study, a new perspective is adopted which utilizes a knowledge-driven approach for path planning. The concept of relative state tree is proposed to develop an incremental learning method based on a path planning knowledge base. The knowledge library, which stores a collection of the mappings from environmental information to robot decisions, can be established by offline or online learnings. As the robot plans online, its movement is guided by the optimal decision that is retrieved from the library based on the information which matches mostly the current environment.

Dragging actions can change the distribution of dirt in an unpredictable manner, and thus the planning becomes challenging. We propose to define the problem using explicitly uncertain actions, and then plan the most effective sequence of actions in terms of time. However, some issues have to be tackled to plan efficiently with stochastic actions. States become hard to predict after executing a few actions, so replanning every few actions with newer perceptions gives the best results, and the trade-off between planning time and plan quality is also important. Finally a learner is integrated to provide adaptation to changes, such as different rag grasps, robots, or cleaning surfaces. We demonstrate experimentally, using two different robot platforms, that planning is more advantageous than simple reactive strategies for accomplishing complex tasks, while still providing a similar performance for easy tasks. We also performed experiments where the rag grasp was changed, and thus the behaviour of the dragging actions, showing that the learning capabilities allow the robot to double its performance with a new rag grasp after a few cleaning iterations.",ar,2015-03-01,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,AI planning | Probabilistic planning | Robotics Surface cleaning | Rule learning,2-s2.0-84921792031,S0952197614002760,,Article,Martínez D.,60030064,CSIC-UPC - Instituto de Robotica e Informatica Industrial (IRII),Barcelona,Spain,3,"Martínez, David;Alenyà, Guillem;Torras, Carme",56494091100;6508265237;7003421114,60030064;60030064;60030064,1 March 2015,9521976,24182,,Journal,39,,,23-32,0,FP7,269959,Seventh Framework Programme,28,2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197614002760?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1177/0278364914554471,Learning grounded finite-state representations from unstructured demonstrations,"Robots exhibit flexible behavior largely in proportion to their degree of knowledge about the world. Such knowledge is often meticulously hand-coded for a narrow class of tasks, limiting the scope of possible robot competencies. Thus, the primary limiting factor of robot capabilities is often not the physical attributes of the robot, but the limited time and skill of expert programmers. One way to deal with the vast number of situations and environments that robots face outside the laboratory is to provide users with simple methods for programming robots that do not require the skill of an expert. For this reason, learning from demonstration (LfD) has become a popular alternative to traditional robot programming methods, aiming to provide a natural mechanism for quickly teaching robots. By simply showing a robot how to perform a task, users can easily demonstrate new tasks as needed, without any special knowledge about the robot. Unfortunately, LfD often yields little knowledge about the world, and thus lacks robust generalization capabilities, especially for complex, multi-step tasks. We present a series of algorithms that draw from recent advances in Bayesian non-parametric statistics and control theory to automatically detect and leverage repeated structure at multiple levels of abstraction in demonstration data. The discovery of repeated structure provides critical insights into task invariants, features of importance, high-level task structure, and appropriate skills for the task. This culminates in the discovery of a finite-state representation of the task, composed of grounded skills that are flexible and reusable, providing robust generalization and transfer in complex, multi-step robotic tasks. These algorithms are tested and evaluated using a PR2 mobile manipulator, showing success on several complex real-world tasks, such as furniture assembly.",ar,2015-03-03,International Journal of Robotics Research,Bayesian nonparametrics | Learning from demonstration | Personal robotics | Skill learning | Time-series analysis,2-s2.0-84921941296,,,Article,Niekum S.,60159891;60104841;60076698;60014313;60006320;60000461,Vicarious AI;The Robotics Institute;Bosch Research and Technology Center;University of Massachusetts Amherst;MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory;SRI International,Union City;Pittsburgh;Palo Alto;Amherst MA;Cambridge;Menlo Park,United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,6,"Niekum, Scott;Osentoski, Sarah;Konidaris, George;Chitta, Sachin;Marthi, Bhaskara;Barto, Andrew G.",15080949400;6506867688;14822243500;6602631016;22980042100;7003417191,60104841-60014313;60076698;60006320;60000461;60159891;60014313,3 March 2015,2783649,18050,17413176,Journal,34,2,,131-157,0,NSF,IIS-1208497,National Science Foundation,104,2015,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364914554471,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1080/01691864.2014.964314,Humanoid robot imitation through continuous goal-directed actions: An evolutionary approach,"Humanoids can learn motor skills through the programming by demonstration framework, which allows matching the kinematic movements of a robot with those of a human. Continuous goal-directed actions (CGDA) is a framework that can complement the paradigm of robot imitation. Instead of kinematic parameters, its encoding is centered on the changes an action produces on object features. The features can be any measurable characteristic of the object such as color, area, etc. The execution of actions encoded as CGDA allows a robot-configuration independent achievement of tasks, avoiding the correspondence problem. By tracking object features during action execution, we create a trajectory in an n-dimensional feature space that represents object temporal states, allowing generalization, recognition, and execution of action effects on the environment. Experiments have been performed, using a humanoid robot in a simulated environment. Evolutionary computation was used for joint parameter calculation of a humanoid robot.

NO,10.1177/0278364914557874,Robot navigation in dense human crowds: Statistical models and experimental studies of human-robot cooperation,"We consider the problem of navigating a mobile robot through dense human crowds. We begin by exploring a fundamental impediment to classical motion planning algorithms called the ""freezing robot problem"": once the environment surpasses a certain level of dynamic complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. We argue that this problem can be avoided if the robot anticipates human cooperation, and accordingly we develop interacting Gaussian processes, a prediction density that captures cooperative collision avoidance, and a ""multiple goal"" extension that models the goal-driven nature of human decision making. We validate this model with an empirical study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance. The multiple goal interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities nearing 0.8 humans/m2, while a state-of-the-art non-cooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than three times as often as the multiple goal extension, and twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian process approach. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used dynamic window approach proves insufficient for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2. We also show that our non-cooperative planner or our reactive planner capture the salient characteristics of nearly any dynamic navigation algorithm. Based on these experimental results and theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is critical for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds.",ar,2015-03-15,International Journal of Robotics Research,adaptive control | cognitive robotics | design and control | human-centered and life-like robotics | Learning and adaptive systems | mechanics | social human-robot interaction,2-s2.0-84924736512,,,Article,Trautman P.,60031581;60025858;60009037;110855001,"California Institute of Technology;ETH Zürich;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;Matrix Research, Inc.","Pasadena;Zurich ZH,;Pasadena;Dayton",United States;Switzerland;United States;United States,4,"Trautman, Pete;Ma, Jeremy;Murray, Richard M.;Krause, Andreas",36803082100;35409805400;55921248200;26659842300,110855001;60009037;60031581;60025858,15 March 2015,2783649,18050,17413176,Journal,34,3,,335-356,0,Caltech,undefined,Boeing,121,2015,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364914557874,,Excluido por no educación

We illustrate the fit of enactivism as a theory of learning with data from an ongoing research project involving teachers and elementary-aged children’s engagement in the design and assembly of motorized robots. We offer that spatial reasoning with its considerations of physical context, the dynamics of a body moving through space, sensorimotor coordination, and cognition, appears different from other conceptual competencies in mathematics. Specifically, we argue that learner engagements with diverse types of informationally ‘dense’ visuo-spatial interfaces (e.g., blueprints, programming icons, blocks, maps), as in the research study, afford some of the necessary experiences with/in a vast number of cases described by Varela et al.

BILCA consists of two steps: (i) first step in which the actuator commands are learned using FA and demonstrations of desired behavior, and (ii) second step in which the obtained wheel commands are evaluated through the real world experiment. Two different problems are considered in this study: trajectory reproduction, and generation of visual control commands for correction of robot orientation. Developed simulations are used to evaluate BILCA in the domain of learning actuator commands for reproduction of different complex trajectories. Results show that the bigger firefly swarms produce better results in terms of accuracy in the final mobile robot pose, and that the desired trajectory is reproduced with minimal error in final control iteration. Likewise, simulations prove that the FA outperforms other metaheuristic techniques. Experiment conducted on a real mobile robot in indoor environment unifies two considered problems within a single transportation task. Depending of the feature position in the image plane, the homography controller for forward motion or the BILCA based controller for robot orientation correction is employed.

NO,10.1142/S0218194015500047,Mining Class Temporal Specification Dynamically Based on Extended Markov Model,"Class temporal specification is a kind of important program specifications especially for object-oriented programs, which specifies that interface methods of a class should be called in a particular sequence. Currently, most existing approaches mine this kind of specifications based on finite state automaton. Observed that finite state automaton is a kind of deterministic models with inability to tolerate noise. In this paper, we propose to mine class temporal specifications relying on a probabilistic model extending from Markov chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of learning specifications from object-oriented programs dynamically based on probabilistic models. Different from similar works, our technique does not require annotating programs. Additionally, it learns specifications in an online mode, which can refine existing models continuously. Above all, we talk about problems regarding noise and connectivity of mined models and a strategy of computing thresholds is proposed to resolve them. To investigate our technique's feasibility and effectiveness, we implemented our technique in a prototype tool ISpecMiner and used it to conduct several experiments. Results of the experiments show that our technique can deal with noise effectively and useful specifications can be learned.

In order to do this, the toolbox aims at the fulfillment of a set of practical sessions that allow the students to test most of the concepts of an introductory course in robotic manipulators. In addition, the library possesses features that typically needed the usage of proprietary software, such as the visualization of a realistic 3D representation of commercial robotic arms and the programming of those arms in an industrial language. The practices include the concepts of direct and inverse kinematics, inverse and direct dynamics, path planning and robot programming. As a transversal practice, during the sessions, the student is asked to choose and integrate a new robotic arm in the library, proposing a particular solution to the direct and inverse kinematic problem, as well as the inclusion of other important parameters. The library has been deployed during the last year in bachelor and master studies and has received a nice acceptance. Finally, the library has been assessed in terms of usefulness, design and usage by means of a student survey.

NO,10.1007/s10270-013-0325-9,VPML: an approach to detect design patterns of MOF-based modeling languages,"A design pattern is a recurring and well-understood design fragment. In a model-driven engineering methodology, detecting occurrences of design patterns supports the activities of model comprehension and maintenance. With the recent explosion of domain-specific modeling languages, each with its own syntax and semantics, there has been a corresponding explosion in approaches to detecting design patterns that are so much tailored to those many languages that they are difficult to reuse. This makes developing generic analysis tools extremely hard. Such a generic tool is however desirable to reduce the learning curve for pattern designers as they specify patterns for different languages used to model different aspects of a system. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to detecting design patterns of MOF-based modeling languages. MOF is increasingly used to define modeling languages, including UML and BPMN. In our approach, a pattern is modeled with a Visual Pattern Modeling Language and mapped to a corresponding QVT-Relations transformation. Such a transformation runs over an input model where pattern occurrences are to be detected and reports those occurrences in a result model. The approach is prototyped on Eclipse and validated in two large case studies that involve detecting design patterns—specifically a subset of GoF patterns in a UML model and a subset of Control Flow patterns in a BPMN model. Results show that the approach is adequate for modeling complex design patterns for MOF-based modeling languages and detecting their occurrences with high accuracy and performance.",ar,2015-05-01,Software and Systems Modeling,BPMN | Design pattern | GoF | Modeling | MOF | QVT | UML | VPML,2-s2.0-84929061405,,,Article,Elaasar M.,60107857;60072562;60017592,IBM Canada Ltd.;University of Luxembourg;Carleton University,Markham;Esch-sur-Alzette;Ottawa,Canada;Luxembourg;Canada,3,"Elaasar, Maged;Briand, Lionel C.;Labiche, Yvan",8835817100;7006613079;6602305217,60107857;60072562;60017592,1 May 2015,16191366,144641,16191374,Journal,14,2,,735-764,0,NSERC,FNR/P10/03-Validation,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,4,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10270-013-0325-9,,Excluido por nada que ver (design patterns)
NO,10.3390/s150510399,Analyzing systemC designs: SystemC analysis approaches for varying applications,"The complexity of hardware designs is still increasing according to Moore’s law. With embedded systems being more and more intertwined and working together not only with each other, but also with their environments as cyber physical systems (CPSs), more streamlined development workflows are employed to handle the increasing complexity during a system’s design phase. SystemC is a C++ library for the design of hardware/software systems, enabling the designer to quickly prototype, e.g., a distributed CPS without having to decide about particular implementation details (such as whether to implement a feature in hardware or in software) early in the design process. Thereby, this approach reduces the initial implementation’s complexity by offering an abstract layer with which to build a working prototype. However, as SystemC is based on C++, analyzing designs becomes a difficult task due to the complex language features that are available to the designer. Several fundamentally different approaches for analyzing SystemC designs have been suggested. This work illustrates several different SystemC analysis approaches, including their specific advantages and shortcomings, allowing designers to pick the right tools to assist them with a specific problem during the design of a system using SystemC.",ar,2015-05-04,Sensors (Switzerland),Analysis | AOP | ESL | Hardware/software co-design | Machine learning | Parsers | SystemC,2-s2.0-84929346516,,,Article,Stoppe J.,60075096;60008293,German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI);Universität Bremen,Kaiserslautern;Bremen,Germany;Germany,2,"Stoppe, Jannis;Drechsler, Rolf",36667609400;55172914000,60075096;60075096-60008293,4 May 2015,14248220,130124,,Journal,15,5,,10399-10421,1,,undefined,,7,2015,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/5/10399,,Excluido por nada que ver
NO,10.5772/60093,Understanding human hand gestures for learning robot pick-and-place tasks,"Programming robots by human demonstration is an intuitive approach, especially by gestures. Because robot pick-and-place tasks are widely used in industrial factories, this paper proposes a framework to learn robot pick-andplace tasks by understanding human hand gestures. The proposed framework is composed of the module of gesture recognition and the module of robot behaviour control. For the module of gesture recognition, transport empty (TE), transport loaded (TL), grasp (G), and release (RL) from Gilbreth's therbligs are the hand gestures to be recognized. A convolution neural network (CNN) is adopted to recognize these gestures from a camera image. To achieve the robust performance, the skin model by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to filter out non-skin colours of an image, and the calibration of position and orientation is applied to obtain the neutral hand pose before the training and testing of the CNN. For the module of robot behaviour control, the corresponding robot motion primitives to TE, TL, G, and RL, respectively, are implemented in the robot. To manage the primitives in the robot system, a behaviour-based programming platform based on the Extensible Agent Behavior Specification Language (XABSL) is adopted. Because the XABSL provides the flexibility and re-usability of the robot primitives, the hand motion sequence from the module of gesture recognition can be easily used in the XABSL programming platform to implement the robot pick-and-place tasks. The experimental evaluation of seven subjects performing seven hand gestures showed that the average recognition rate was 95.96%. Moreover, by the XABSL programming platform, the experiment showed the cube-stacking task was easily programmed by human demonstration.",ar,2015-05-06,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,Convolution neural network (CNN) | Extensible Agent Behavior Specification Language (XABSL) | Gaussian mixture model (GMM) | Gesture recognition | Human demonstration | Pick-and-place | Robot behaviour control,2-s2.0-84932598723,,,Article,Lin H.I.,60029238;60012392,Mackay Memorial Hospital Taiwan;National Taipei University of Technology,Taipei;Taipei,Taiwan;Taiwan,2,"Lin, Hsien I.;Chiang, Y.

The robot needs to reason about task requirements and ground these in the sensorimotor information. Grasping and interaction with objects are challenging in real-world scenarios, where sensorimotor uncertainty is prevalent. This paper presents a probabilistic framework for the representation and modeling of robot-grasping tasks. The framework consists of Gaussian mixture models for generic data discretization, and discrete Bayesian networks for encoding the probabilistic relations among various task-relevant variables, including object and action features as well as task constraints. We evaluate the framework using a grasp database generated in a simulated environment including a human and two robot hand models. The generative modeling approach allows the prediction of grasping tasks given uncertain sensory data, as well as object and grasp selection in a task-oriented manner. Furthermore, the graphical model framework provides insights into dependencies between variables and features relevant for object grasping.",ar,2015-06-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Cognitive human-robot interaction | grasping | learning and adaptive systems | probabilistic graphical models | recognition,2-s2.0-84926395738,,,Article,Song D.,60002014,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Stockholm,Sweden,4,"Song, Dan;Ek, Carl Henrik;Huebner, Kai;Kragic, Danica",57198791084;23967748100;16039392500;6701873248,60002014;60002014;60002014;60002014,June 2015,15523098,95101,,Journal,31,3,7078848,546-561,1,,undefined,,37,2015,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7078848,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1109/TAMD.2015.2427233,"Structural bootstrapping-A novel, generative mechanism for faster and more efficient acquisition of action-knowledge","Humans, but also robots, learn to improve their behavior. Without existing knowledge, learning either needs to be explorative and, thus, slow or-to be more efficient-it needs to rely on supervision, which may not always be available. However, once some knowledge base exists an agent can make use of it to improve learning efficiency and speed. This happens for our children at the age of around three when they very quickly begin to assimilate new information by making guided guesses how this fits to their prior knowledge. This is a very efficient generative learning mechanism in the sense that the existing knowledge is generalized into as-yet unexplored, novel domains. So far generative learning has not been employed for robots and robot learning remains to be a slow and tedious process. The goal of the current study is to devise for the first time a general framework for a generative process that will improve learning and which can be applied at all different levels of the robot's cognitive architecture. To this end, we introduce the concept of structural bootstrapping-borrowed and modified from child language acquisition-to define a probabilistic process that uses existing knowledge together with new observations to supplement our robot's data-base with missing information about planning-, object-, as well as, action-relevant entities. In a kitchen scenario, we use the example of making batter by pouring and mixing two components and show that the agent can efficiently acquire new knowledge about planning operators, objects as well as required motor pattern for stirring by structural bootstrapping.

Regardless of one's field - design or science - interaction design projects often benefit from efficient production methods for prototypes for beginners. This paper presents an educational case study and its pedagogical lessons from a project-based course for beginning design students to produce interactive prototypes using sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers. A series of short project-based modules using scaffolding of code templates in conjunction with toolkits for physical prototypes were introduced in order to learn fundamental technical knowledge and skills in the first half; then more open-ended investigation of project-based individual creative final projects followed. Each module can be completed in one day with instructions on prototyping and programming in pairs, allowing students to build and see abstract logic in programming through the physical behaviors of prototypes without overpowering student creativity and motivation. Students can reinterpret given materials and modify them to produce custom tools that can realize their original project goals. This strategy allows students to acquire extensible knowledge that does not rely on higher-level software functions or specialized but inflexible plug-ins.

NO,10.1007/s10994-014-5471-y,Meta-interpretive learning of higher-order dyadic datalog: predicate invention revisited,"Since the late 1990s predicate invention has been under-explored within inductive logic programming due to difficulties in formulating efficient search mechanisms. However, a recent paper demonstrated that both predicate invention and the learning of recursion can be efficiently implemented for regular and context-free grammars, by way of metalogical substitutions with respect to a modified Prolog meta-interpreter which acts as the learning engine. New predicate symbols are introduced as constants representing existentially quantified higher-order variables. The approach demonstrates that predicate invention can be treated as a form of higher-order logical reasoning. In this paper we generalise the approach of meta-interpretive learning (MIL) to that of learning higher-order dyadic datalog programs. We show that with an infinite signature the higher-order dyadic datalog class (Formula presented.) has universal Turing expressivity though (Formula presented.) is decidable given a finite signature. Additionally we show that Knuth–Bendix ordering of the hypothesis space together with logarithmic clause bounding allows our MIL implementation Metagol$$_{D}$$D to PAC-learn minimal cardinality (Formula presented.) definitions. This result is consistent with our experiments which indicate that Metagol$$_{D}$$D efficiently learns compact (Formula presented.) definitions involving predicate invention for learning robotic strategies, the East–West train challenge and NELL. Additionally higher-order concepts were learned in the NELL language learning domain. The Metagol code and datasets described in this paper have been made publicly available on a website to allow reproduction of results in this paper.",ar,2015-07-27,Machine Learning,Abduction | Induction | Learning recursion | Meta-interpretation | Predicate invention,2-s2.0-84938965400,,,Article,Muggleton S.H.,60015150,Imperial College London,London,United Kingdom,3,"Muggleton, Stephen H.;Lin, Dianhuan;Tamaddoni-Nezhad, Alireza",7003491952;55331991700;8666181900,60015150;60015150;60015150,27 July 2015,8856125,24775,15730565,Journal,100,1,,49-73,1,,undefined,,95,2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-014-5471-y,,Excluido por nada que ver

NO,10.1109/TRO.2015.2441511,Extending the Applicability of POMDP Solutions to Robotic Tasks,"Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are used in many robotic task classes from soccer to household chores. Determining an approximately optimal action policy for POMDPs is PSPACE-complete, and the exponential growth of computation time prohibits solving large tasks. This paper describes two techniques to extend the range of robotic tasks that can be solved using a POMDP. Our first technique reduces the motion constraints of a robot and, then, uses state-of-the-art robotic motion planning techniques to respect the true motion constraints at runtime. We then propose a novel task decomposition that can be applied to some indoor robotic tasks. This decomposition transforms a long time horizon task into a set of shorter tasks. We empirically demonstrate the performance gain provided by these two techniques through simulated execution in a variety of environments. Comparing a direct formulation of a POMDP to solving our proposed reductions, we conclude that the techniques proposed in this paper can provide significant enhancement to current POMDP solution techniques, extending the POMDP instances that can be solved to include large continuous-state robotic tasks.",ar,2015-08-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Autonomous vehicles | partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) | plan execution | robotics | uncertainty,2-s2.0-85027916652,,,Article,Grady D.,60006191;60005286,Google LLC;Rice University,Mountain View;Houston,United States;United States,3,"Grady, Devin K.;Moll, Mark;Kavraki, Lydia E.",36674970600;15832207500;7004243865,60005286-60006191;60005286;60005286,1 August 2015,15523098,95101,,Journal,31,4,7131561,948-961,0,NSF,1317849,National Science Foundation,15,2015,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7131561,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.5772/61087,Affordance Learning Based on Subtask's Optimal Strategy,"Affordances define the relationships between the robot and environment, in terms of actions that the robot is able to perform. Prior work is mainly about predicting the possibility of a reactive action, and the object's affordance is invariable. However, in the domain of dynamic programming, a robot's task could often be decomposed into several subtasks, and each subtask could limit the search space. As a result, the robot only needs to replan its sub-strategy when an unexpected situation happens, and an object's affordance might change over time depending on the robot's state and current subtask. In this paper, we propose a novel affordance model linking the subtask, object, robot state and optimal action. An affordance represents the first action of the optimal strategy under the current subtask when detecting an object, and its influence is promoted from a primitive action to the subtask strategy. Furthermore, hierarchical reinforcement learning and state abstraction mechanism are introduced to learn the task graph and reduce state space. In the navigation experiment, the robot equipped with a camera could learn the objects' crucial characteristics, and gain their affordances in different subtasks.",ar,2015-08-20,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,affordance | cognitive robotics | hierarchical reinforcement learning | state abstraction | subtask strategy,2-s2.0-84994518923,,,Article,Min H.,60024542,South China University of Technology,Guangzhou,China,6,"Min, Huaqing;Yi, Chang'An;Luo, Ronghua;Bi, Sheng;Shen, Xiaowen;Yan, Yuguang",7102292458;50362183500;7202671129;57202658984;55538803400;56489044800,60024542;60024542;60024542;60024542;60024542;60024542,20 August 2015,17298806,144749,17298814,Journal,12,8,111,,1,,undefined,,5,2015,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5772/61087,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

Pure position control is unsuitable for such tasks because even small errors in the desired trajectory can cause significant deviations from the desired forces and torques. The proposed algorithm takes a reference Cartesian trajectory and force/torque profile as input and adapts the movement so that the resulting forces and torques match the reference profiles. The learning algorithm is based on dynamic movement primitives and quaternion representation of orientation, which provide a mathematical machinery for efficient and stable adaptation. Experimentally we show that the robot’s performance can be significantly improved within a few iteration steps, compensating for vision and other errors that might arise during the execution of the task.

Unlike earlier work, we aim to infer human-readable rules and we seek to develop a relational first-order approach which automatically discovers relevant features rather than relying on a vector of predetermined attributes. To this end we generated a data set by measuring execution times of 60 benchmarks on an embedded system development board and we developed an ILP prototype which outperforms the current state-of-the-art learning approach in 34 of the 60 benchmarks. Finally, we combined the strengths of the current state of the art and our ILP method in a hybrid approach which reduced execution times by an average of 8% and up to 50% in some cases.",ar,2015-09-03,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,compiler optimisation | embedded system | inductive logic programming,2-s2.0-84948416590,S1471068415000174,,Article,Blackmore C.,60020650,University of Bristol,Bristol,United Kingdom,3,"Blackmore, Craig;Ray, Oliver;Eder, Kerstin",56979016700;23398544100;23391989300,60020650;60020650;60020650,3 September 2015,14710684,28424,14753081,Journal,15,4-5,,481-494,0,,undefined,,3,2015,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/article/abs/logic-programming-approach-to-predict-effective-compiler-settings-for-embedded-software/0C8BF58200C9CD4ED23AA5AE62E1B18E,,Excluido por nada que ver (compiler)
NO,10.1088/1748-3190/10/5/055002,Texture recognition and localization in amorphous robotic skin,"We present a soft robotic skin that can recognize and localize texture using a distributed set of sensors and computational elements that are inspired by the Pacinian corpuscle, the fast adapting, uniformly spaced mechanoreceptor with a wide receptive field, which is responsive to vibrations due to rubbing or slip on the skin. Tactile sensing and texture recognition is important for controlled manipulation of objects and navigating in one's environment. Yet, providing robotic systems or prosthetic devices with such capability at high density and bandwidth remains challenging. Each sensor node in the presented skin is created by collocating computational elements with individual microphones. These nodes are networked in a lattice and embedded in EcoFlex rubber, forming an amorphous medium. Unlike existing skins consisting of passive sensor arrays that feed into a central computer, our approach allows for detecting, conditioning and processing of tactile signals in-skin, facilitating the use of high-bandwidth signals, such as vibration, and allowing nodes to respond only to signals of interest. Communication between nodes allows the skin to localize the source of a stimulus, such as rubbing or slip, in a decentralized manner. Signal processing by individual nodes allows the skin to estimate the material touched. Combining these two capabilities, the skin is able to convert high-bandwidth, spatiotemporal information into low-bandwidth, event-driven information. Unlike taxel-based sensing arrays, this amorphous approach greatly reduces the computational load on the central robotic system. We describe the design, analysis, construction, instrumentation and programming of the robotic skin. We demonstrate that a 2.8 square meter skin with 10 sensing nodes is capable of localizing stimulus to within 2 centimeters, and that an individual sensing node can identify 15 textures with an accuracy of 71%. Finally, we discuss how such a skin could be used for full-body sensing in existing robots, augment existing sensing modalities, and how this material may be useful in robotic grasping tasks.",ar,2015-09-09,Bioinspiration and Biomimetics,amorphoush materials | robotic skin | tactile sensing | texture recognition,2-s2.0-84945129053,,26352901,Article,Hughes D.,60000221,University of Colorado Boulder,Boulder,United States,2,"Hughes, Dana;Correll, Nikolaus",36872754800;57203474557,60000221;60000221,9 September 2015,17483182,4700152290,17483190,Journal,10,5,55002,,0,,undefined,,33,2015,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/10/5/055002,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

We assume that the robot has noisy sensors and actuators and model its motion through the regions of the environment as a Markov decision process (MDP). The robot control problem becomes finding the control policy which maximizes the probability of satisfying the temporal logic task on the MDP. For a large environment, obtaining transition probabilities for each state-action pair, as well as solving the necessary optimization problem for the optimal policy, are computationally intensive. To address these issues, we propose an approximate dynamic programming framework based on a least-squares temporal difference learning method of the actor-critic type. This framework operates on sample paths of the robot and optimizes a randomized control policy with respect to a small set of parameters. The transition probabilities are obtained only when needed.

NO,10.11975/j.issn.1002-6819.2015.20.019,Principles of BTOPMC/SCAU distributed watershed hydrological model with system design,"Based on a watershed digital elevation model (DEM) and by dividing a large basin into sub-basins or blocks, the TOPMODEL (TOPgraphic MODEL) concepts were applied for runoff generation and an adaptive Muskingum-Cunge method was proposed for runoff routing. A distributed watershed hydrological model was developed with a strong physical basis, named BTOPMC (a Block-wise use of TOPmodel with the Muskingum-Cunge method). Up to now, the model has been applied to watershed research globally and as a teaching tool of hydrological science in some organizations. In order to apply it to operational hydrological forecasts and water resources management over watersheds, a system named BTOPMC/SCAU (South China Agricultural University) was designed, consisting of 5 layers: data management, models, communication, data illustration and user operation. Data management layer laid at the system base, responsible for data storage and maintenance. Data was divided into two types: structured data and non-structured data respectively stored in relative database manage system and files. As a core of the system, models were consisted of modules of terrain analysis, runoff generation, flow concentration and basin application. The terrain module computed static characters of basin ground. The runoff generation and flow concentration modules computed dynamic hydrological processes by integrating meteorological inputs and basin ground characters. In order to improve modeling efficiency, an OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) programming was used multiple cores of CPUs for parallel computation in the two modules. Based on an epoll mechanism and programmed in C/C++, the communication layer was designed for message passing among other layers and it supported simultaneous multi-users access. Depending on the user's intention it was passible after using some integration tools in the data illustration layer to extract inputs, outputs and some processing results from data layer and intuitively display them in tables or graphs. The user operation layer, which provided a concise GUI (Graphic User Interface), was programmed in Java, so it was able to run in different platforms such as Microsoft Windows, various Unix, Linux and so on. BTOPMC/SCAU was executed in a Client/Server environment where user operation layer and data illustration layer were deployed to clients and models and databases on server. The communication layer passed messages between Clients and Server. In this way, the system can concentrate on the huge burden of hydrological computation, and in the meantime allow large amount of data input and query from many users everywhere for the basin management. Two operation conditions were provided to run the system: calibration and simulation, and the calibration operation supported two methods: manual and automatic ways. In automatic calibration, a global optimization algorithm, SCE-UA (Shuffled Complex Evolution developed at University of Arizona), was used and seven kinds of objective functions ccould be chosen. BTOPMC/SCAU provided a set of sophisticated methods and convenient tools for hydrological forecasting and water resources management over watersheds. It was characterized with (1) A layered architecture but coupled weakly and allowed easy integration of advanced techniques. (2) Communicated in an epoll mechanism and supported multi-users accesses. (3) Modularized in model layer to include more methods and to develop more applications in the future.

NO,10.1115/1.4031089,The MechProcessor: Helping Novices Design Printable Mechanisms Across Different Printers,"Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D-printing, sits at the heart of the Maker Movement-the growing desire for wider-ranges of people to design physical objects. However, most users that wish to design functional moving devices face a prohibitive barrier-to-entry: they need fluency in a computer-aided design (CAD) package. This limits most people to being merely consumers, rather than designers or makers. To solve this problem, we combine advances in mechanism synthesis, computer languages, and design for AM to create a computational framework, the MechProcessor, which allows novices to produce 3D-printable, moving mechanisms of varying complexity using simple and extendable interfaces. The paper describes how we use hierarchical cascading configuration languages, breadth-first search, and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for mechanism synthesis, along with a nested, printable test-case to detect and resolve the AM constraints needed to ensure the devices can be 3D printed. We provide physical case studies and an open-source library of code and mechanisms that enable others to easily extend the MechProcessor framework. This encourages new research, commercial, and educational directions, including new types of customized printable robotics, business models for customer-driven design, and STEM education initiatives that involve nontechnical audiences in mechanical design. By promoting novice interaction in complex design and fabrication of movable components, we can move society closer to the true promise of the Maker Movement: turning consumers into designers.",ar,2015-11-01,"Journal of Mechanical Design, Transactions of the ASME",,2-s2.0-84944186687,,,Article,Fuge M.,60078684,A.

Theoretically, combining logic and probability in a unified representation and building general-purpose reasoning tools for it has been the dream of AI, dating back to the late 1980s. Practically, successful statistical relational AI tools enable new applications in several large, complex real-world domains including those involving big data, natural text, social networks, the web, medicine and robotics, among others. Such domains are often characterized by rich relational structure and large amounts of uncertainty. Logic helps to faithfully model the former while probability helps to effectively manage the latter.

These learning technologies distribute online educational multimedia contents through technological platforms. Even though specific e-learning tools for technical disciplines were already available on the Internet, in our opinion more general tools, typically involving calculations, plots or diagrams, through the use of spreadsheets or graphical applications, were still needed to provide a more flexible and multi-purpose integrated environment. Therefore, we developed an integrated system to supply e-learning platforms with almost the same functionalities offered by standalone Office Automation applications. Modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (MOODLE) and OpenOffice.org were selected to deal with any problem originating from the software and to smooth over the users' learning curve. Furthermore, MOODLE is a modular platform and offers an extensive application programming interface for coding in a simple and effective manner. The implementation of the work required the employment of Java and Asynchronous JavaScript and Extensible Markup Language technologies and included the creation of a Java Applet to be embedded in the web pages of the new MOODLE modules. Students could thus be offered a single working environment for handling “traditional” material and performing practical activities.

Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a well-known hybrid neurofuzzy structure for modelling the engineering system. It has also taken the advantages of both learning ability of neural network and the reasoning ability of the fuzzy inference system. In this navigational model, different sensor-extracted information, such as front obstacle distance, right obstacle distance, left obstacle distance, heading angle, left wheel velocity and right wheel velocity, are given input to the ANFIS controller and output from the controller is steering angle for the robot. Based on the output information, the robot moves safely in an unstructured environment populated by variety of static obstacles.

In the factory of the future, it is necessary to rapidly reprogram flexible mobile manipulators to perform new tasks, when the need arises, for which a working system capable of TbD would be ideal. Contrary to current TbD approaches, that generally aim to recognize both action and where it is applied, we propose a division of labor, where the operator manually specifies the action the robot should perform, while gestures are used for specifying the relevant action parameter (e.g. on which object to apply the action). Using this two-step method has the advantages that there is no uncertainty of which action the robot will perform, it takes into account that the environment changes, so objects do not need to be at predefined locations, and the parameter specification is possible even for inexperienced users.

The motivation of its development is to achieve more robustness against changes of task conditions than conventional teaching/playback without losing its general versatility. For proof of concept, the method was implemented and tested on a virtual environment. The method is composed of two parts: teaching phase and playback phase. In the teaching phase, a human operator commands a robot to achieve a manipulation task. All the movements of the robot are recorded. All the images of the teaching scenes are also recorded by a camera. Then, a mapping from the recorded images to the movements is obtained as an artificial neural network. In the playback phase, the motion of the robot is determined by the output of the neural network calculated from scene images. We applied this view-based teaching/playback to pick-and-place and pushing by a robot hand with eight degrees of freedom in the virtual environment. Human demonstrated manipulation was successfully reproduced by the robot hand with our proposed method. Moreover, manipulation of the object from some initial positions that are not identical to those in the demonstrations was also successfully achieved with our method.",ar,2015-12-01,ROBOMECH Journal,Neural networks | Robot programming | View-based approach,2-s2.0-85013133538,,,Article,Maeda Y.,60018279;60018131,Yokohama National University;Nikon Corporation,Yokohama;Tokyo,Japan;Japan,2,"Maeda, Yusuke;Nakamura, Takahito",35378130800;57200942105,60018279;60018131,1 December 2015,,21100853738,21974225,Journal,2,1,2,,1,KAKEN,24560286,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,10,2015,https://robomechjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40648-014-0025-4,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1007/s10846-015-0178-2,Robotic Ubiquitous Cognitive Ecology for Smart Homes,"Robotic ecologies are networks of heterogeneous robotic devices pervasively embedded in everyday environments, where they cooperate to perform complex tasks. While their potential makes them increasingly popular, one fundamental problem is how to make them both autonomous and adaptive, so as to reduce the amount of preparation, pre-programming and human supervision that they require in real world applications. The project RUBICON develops learning solutions which yield cheaper, adaptive and efficient coordination of robotic ecologies. The approach we pursue builds upon a unique combination of methods from cognitive robotics, machine learning, planning and agent-based control, and wireless sensor networks. This paper illustrates the innovations advanced by RUBICON in each of these fronts before describing how the resulting techniques have been integrated and applied to a proof of concept smart home scenario. The resulting system is able to provide useful services and pro-actively assist the users in their activities. RUBICON learns through an incremental and progressive approach driven by the feedback received from its own activities and from the user, while also self-organizing the manner in which it uses available sensors, actuators and other functional components in the process.

This is an onerous task, especially when each workpiece has a different shape. In this paper, a teaching-less robot system for the finishing of two-dimensional workpieces of various shapes and thicknesses using computer vision is proposed. The robot system does not require shape information for the workpiece to be included in the CAD data or to be input by the operator. Each workpiece shape is acquired by segmenting edges into straight lines and circular arcs from the image data of the workpiece. The robot-language program for each workpiece is generated automatically from the workpiece shape data and finishing condition data.

Nowadays, complex construction tasks using mobile robots are characterized by three fundamental problems: assembly planning, motion planning, and path tracking control. The high-level plan to perform the construction task consists of assembly mode algorithms that are derived offline in a simulation environment through learning and heuristic search. A promising approach to design and optimize the path tracking controllers for a quadrotor as well as the attitude controllers using RL is presented.

NO,10.1016/j.neucom.2014.09.092,A hierarchical path planning approach based on A<sup>*</sup> and least-squares policy iteration for mobile robots,"In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical path planning approach for mobile robot navigation in complex environments. The proposed approach has a two-level structure. In the first level, the A* algorithm based on grids is used to find a geometric path quickly and several path points are selected as subgoals for the next level. In the second level, an approximate policy iteration algorithm called least-squares policy iteration (LSPI) is used to learn a near-optimal local planning policy that can generate smooth trajectories under kinematic constraints of the robot. Using this near-optimal local planning policy, the mobile robot can find an optimized path by sequentially approaching the subgoals obtained in the first level. One advantage of the proposed approach is that the kinematic characteristics of the mobile robot can be incorporated into the LSPI-based path optimization procedure. The second advantage is that the LSPI-based local path optimizer uses an approximate policy iteration algorithm which has been proven to be data-efficient and stable. The training of the local path optimizer can use sample experiences collected randomly from any reasonable sampling distribution. Furthermore, the LSPI-based local path optimizer has the ability of dealing with uncertainties in the environment. For unknown obstacles, it just needs to replan the path in the second level rather than the whole planner. Simulations for path planning in various types of environments have been carried out and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",ar,2015-12-25,Neurocomputing,A  search * | Hierarchical path planning | Least squares policy iteration (LSPI) | Mobile robots | Optimality | Reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-84940614866,S0925231215005676,,Article,Zuo L.,60024350,National University of Defense Technology,Changsha,China,4,"Zuo, Lei;Guo, Qi;Xu, Xin;Fu, Hao",40561980000;56013213400;57071888700;50861240800,60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350,25 December 2015,9252312,24807,18728286,Journal,170,,,257-266,0,NSFC,91220301,National Natural Science Foundation of China,48,2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231215005676?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.5772/62180,The local definability of robotic largescale knowledge based on splitting,"In order to reduce the computational tasks in robots with large-scale and complex knowledge, several methods of robotic knowledge localization have been proposed over the past decades. Logic is an important and useful tool for complex robotic reasoning, action planning, learning and verification. This paper uses propositional atoms in logic to describe the affecting factors of robotic large-scale knowledge. Definability in logic reasoning shows that truths of some propositional atoms are decided by other propositional atoms. Definability technology is an important method to eliminate inessential propositional atoms in robotic large-scale and complex knowledge, so the computational tasks in robotic knowledge can be completed faster. On the other hand, by applying the splitting technique, the knowledge base can be equivalently divided into a number of sub-knowledge bases, without sharing any propositional atoms with others. In this paper, we show that the inessential propositional atoms can be decided faster by the local definability technology based on the splitting method, first formed in local belief revision by Parikh in 1999. Hence, the decision-making in robotic large-scale and complex knowledge is more effective.",ar,2016-01-01,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,Definability | Localization | Robotic knowledge | Splitting,2-s2.0-85002616406,,,Article,Wu M.,60073558;60005027,Huzhou University;Guizhou University,Huzhou;Guiyang,China;China,3,"Wu, Maonian;Jiang, Yunliang;Zhu, Shaojun",57226823303;8202994400;35118359700,60073558-60005027;60073558;60073558,2016,17298806,144749,17298814,Journal,13,1,62180,,1,,undefined,,0,2016,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5772/62180,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.20965/jrm.2016.p0017,Collision avoidance using contact information with multiple objects by multi-leg robot,"In robotics, a walking through motion is complex because of the presence of multipoint contact objects in the working environment of a robot. To simplify the walking through motion of a robot, a virtual impedance field is implemented to the contact points of the robot and an object so that the robot avoids the object passively. The traveling direction of the robot is altered by a virtual repulsive force obtained from the position of the estimated obstacle and the virtual impedance field. The resulting action depends on the parameter of virtual impedance coefficients. Because a combination of parameters includes many things, reinforcement learning is employed to obtain an optimal motion. The optimization of the multipoint contact walking through motion of a robot is finally achieved by evaluating the walking motion while encountering complex obstacles in a dynamic simulator. The motion is implemented on a hexapod robot, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",ar,2016-01-01,Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics,Hexapod robot | Motion planning | Multi-legged robot | Obstacle avoidance,2-s2.0-84973538508,,,Article,Takubo T.,60101699;60027762;60024322;60013722,Mitsubishi Electric Corporation;Meijo University;Osaka University;Osaka City University,Tokyo;Nagoya;Suita;Osaka,Japan;Japan;Japan;Japan,5,"Takubo, Tomohito;Kominami, Keishi;Ohara, Kenichi;Mae, Yasushi;Arai, Tatsuo",7004435990;55604834700;7201677988;7003523565;55500429000,60013722;60024322-60101699;60027762;60024322;60024322,2016,9153942,21100197345,18838049,Journal,28,1,,17-30,0,,undefined,,2,2016,https://www.fujipress.jp/jrm/rb/robot002800010017/,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

In this article we propose a novel approach to deform trajectories while keeping their local shape similar, which is based on the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operator. The approach can be readily extended and covers multiple deformation techniques including fixed waypoints that must be passed, positional constraints for collision avoidance or a cooperative manipulation scheme for the coordination of multiple robots. Due to its low computational complexity it allows for real-time trajectory deformation both on local and global scale and online adaptation to changed environmental constraints. Simulations illustrate the straightforward combination of the proposed approach with other established trajectory-related methods like artificial potential fields or prioritized inverse kinematics.

Finally, the authors use fully connected layers of neural networks to accomplish the path planning task. Findings-The NAO biomimetic robot respond quickly and correctly to the dynamic environment. The simulation experiments show that the deep neural network outperforms in dynamic and static environment than the conventional method.

Motion capture system (mocap) was used to plan an initial suboptimal motion. Reinforcement learning was then implemented to optimize the trajectories with respect to kinematic and torque limits at the both body and the joint level. The cost functions in the body level calculated a robot’s static balancing ability, collisions and validity of the end-effector movement. Balancing and collision checks were computed from kinematic models of the robot and the vehicle model. Energy consumption such as torque limit obedience was checked at the joint level. Energy cost was approximated as joint torque, measured from a dynamic model. Various penalties such as joint angle and velocity limits were also computed in the joint level. Physical limits of each joint ensured both spatial and temporal smoothness of the generated trajectories.

Different from existing studies, we take the prescheduled unavailability periods, such as lunch and tea breaks, into account in order to reflect a more realistic production environment. This problem includes allocating operations to the stations and satisfying the demand and cycle time within a desired interval for each model to be produced. We also ensure that assignability, precedence, and tool life constraints are met. Furthermore, the existing studies in the literature overlook the limited lives of the tools that are used for production. Tool replacement decisions not only affect the tooling cost, but also the production rate. Therefore, we determine the number of stations and allocate the operations into the stations in such a way that tool change periods coincide with the unavailability periods to eliminate tool change related line stoppages in a mixed model robotic assembly line.

The TekBots Platforms for Learning™ (TekBots® PFL) developed at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) of Oregon State University (OSU) in the United States have integrated a curriculum into a coherent whole while providing an environment for innovation. The TekBots, which are an automobile robot and a platform for learning created for electrical and computer engineering students, have been designed to assist teaching many practical engineering skills; innovation, design, knowledge integration, and the ""real"" problem solutions of ""real"" systems. With the hands-on TekBots, the students can experience the real meaning to many of the seemingly ambiguous topics presented in lecture. The department of Electrical Engineering at Fukuoka Institute of Technology (FIT) has introduced this TekBots PFL to improve its engineering curriculum and has developed the TekBots course program used at FIT in a small scale. The program has been built by four subjects; Freshmen Laboratory for Electrical Engineering, C Programming, Mechatronics I and II. A TekBots project ""TekBots Global Vision System"" for a graduation thesis has also been carried out. Since two subjects, the Freshmen Laboratory for Electrical Engineering and the C Programming, have already been reported in our previous paper, this paper treats the results of implementation on the Mechatronics I and II.

NO,10.1108/IR-05-2015-0092,The design of an intelligent soccer-playing robot,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design intelligent robots operating in such dynamic environments like the RoboCup Middle-Size League (MSL). In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18-X 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings: Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots.

Robotics offers a playful and tangible way for children to engage with both T and E concepts during their foundational early childhood years. This study looks at N = 60 children in pre-kindergarten through second grade who completed an 8-week robotics curriculum in their classrooms using the KIWI robotics kit combined with a tangible programming language. Children were assessed on their knowledge of foundational robotics and programming concepts upon completion of the curriculum. Results show that beginning in pre-kindergarten, children were able to master basic robotics and programming skills, while the older children were able to master increasingly complex concepts using the same robotics kit in the same amount of time.

NO,10.1007/s11554-013-0353-2,Accelerating embedded image processing for real time: a case study,"Many image processing applications need real-time performance, while having restrictions of size, weight and power consumption. Common solutions, including hardware/software co-designs, are based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Their main drawback is long development time. In this work, a co-design methodology for processor-centric embedded systems with hardware acceleration using FPGAs is proposed. The goal of this methodology is to achieve real-time embedded solutions, using hardware acceleration, but achieving development time similar to that of software projects. Well established methodologies, techniques and languages from the software domain—such as Object-Oriented Paradigm design, Unified Modelling Language, and multithreading programming—are applied; and semiautomatic C-to-HDL translation tools and methods are used and compared. The methodology is applied to achieve an embedded implementation of a global vision algorithm for the localization of multiple robots in an e-learning robotic laboratory. The algorithm is specifically developed to work reliably 24/7 and to detect the robot’s positions and headings even in the presence of partial occlusions and varying lighting conditions expectable in a normal classroom. The co-designed implementation of this algorithm processes 1,600 × 1,200 pixel images at a rate of 32 fps with an estimated energy consumption of 17 mJ per frame. It achieves a 16× acceleration and 92 % energy saving, which compares favorably with the most optimized embedded software solutions.

NO,10.1002/asmb.2145,A random forest application to contact-state classification for robot programming by human demonstration,"This paper addresses the non-parametric estimation of the stochastic process related to the classification problem that arises in robot programming by demonstration of compliant motion tasks. Robot programming by demonstration is a robot programming paradigm in which a human operator demonstrates the task to be performed by the robot. In such demonstration, several observable variables, such as velocities and forces can be modeled, non-parametrically, in order to classify the current state of a contact between an object manipulated by the robot and the environment in which it operates. Essential actions in compliant motion tasks are the contacts that take place, and therefore, it is important to understand the sequence of contact states made during a demonstration, called contact classification. We propose a contact classification algorithm based on the random forest algorithm. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not depend on the geometric model of the objects involved in the demonstration. Moreover, it does not rely on the kinestatic model of the contact interactions. The comparison with state-of-the-art contact classifiers shows that random forest classifier is more accurate.",ar,2016-03-01,Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry,multi-class contact classification | sensor force analysis | supervised learning,2-s2.0-84949639522,,,Article,Cabras S.,60032259;60018940;60001741,Università degli Studi di Cagliari;Universidad Rey Juan Carlos;Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Cagliari;Madrid;Madrid,Italy;Spain;Spain,3,"Cabras, S.;Castellanos, M.

NO,10.1002/cae.21707,Implementing fuzzy logic to simulate a process of inference on sensory stimuli of deaf people in an e-learning environment,"A novel approach to education aimed at deaf students, based on computing that performs individualized instruction on the domain of programming languages is presented. This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application model, called model of Mental Architecture Digitized - AMD. In particular, performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The concept of AMD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. AMD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus, the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The transmission and retention of knowledge rests on the cognitive faculty of the concepts linked to it. The repeatability of your applications builds a solid foundation for Education, according to behavioral standards set.

Human trajectories are generally not random and can belong to gross patterns. Knowledge about these patterns can be learned through observation. In this paper, we address the problem of a robot's social awareness by learning human motion patterns and integrating them in path planning. The gross motion patterns are learned using a novel Sampled Hidden Markov Model, which allows the integration of partial observations in dynamic model building. This model is used in the modified A∗ path planning algorithm to achieve socially aware trajectories. Novelty of the proposed method is that it can be used on a mobile robot for simultaneous online learning and path planning.

NO,10.1007/s10489-015-0660-3,Altruistic coordination for multi-robot cooperative pathfinding,"When multiple robots perform tasks in a shared workspace, they might be confronted with the risk of blocking each other’s ways, which will lead to conflicts or interference among them. Planning collision-free paths for all the robots is a challenge for a multi-robot system, which is also known as the multi-robot cooperative pathfinding problem in which each robot has to navigate from its starting location to the destination while keeping avoiding stationary obstacles as well as the other robots. In this paper, we present a novel fully decentralized approach to this problem. Our approach allows robots to make real-time responses to dynamic environments and can resolve a set of benchmark deadlock situations subject to complex spatial constraints in a shared workspace by means of altruistic coordination. Specifically, when confronted with congested situations, each robot can employ waiting, moving-forwards, dodging, retreating and turning-head strategies to make local adjustments. Most importantly, each robot only needs to coordinate and communicate with the others that are located within its coordinated network in our approach, which can reduce communication overhead in fully decentralized multi-robot systems.

NO,10.1007/s11370-015-0193-y,Efficient terrain coverage for deploying wireless sensor nodes on multi-robot system,Coverage and connectivity are the two main functionalities of wireless sensor network. Stochastic node deployment or random deployment almost always cause hole in sensing coverage and cause redundant nodes in area. In the other hand precise deployment of nodes in large area is very time consuming and even impossible in hazardous environment. One of solution for this problem is using mobile robots with concern on exploration algorithm for mobile robot. In this work an autonomous deployment method for wireless sensor nodes is proposed via multi-robot system which robots are considered as node carrier. Developing an exploration algorithm based on spanning tree is the main contribution and this exploration algorithm is performing fast localization of sensor nodes in energy efficient manner. Employing multi-robot system and path planning with spanning tree algorithm is a strategy for speeding up sensor nodes deployment. A novel improvement of this technique in deployment of nodes is having obstacle avoidance mechanism without concern on shape and size of obstacle.

Existing systems build such translators manually. As a result, it takes a great deal of effort to support new architectures. Even for widely deployed architectures, full instruction sets may not be modeled, e.g., mature systems such as Valgrind still lack support for AVX, FMA4 and SSE4.1 for x86 processors. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge about instruction set semantics that is already embedded into modern compilers such as GCC. In particular, we present a learning-based approach for automating the translation of assembly instructions to a compiler's architecture-neutral IL.

To efficiently recognise the environment under these two limitations, attention of an intelligent agent is controlled by employing the reinforcement learning framework. We propose an estimation method using estimated mixture-of-experts task and attention learning in perceptual space. An agent learns how to employ its sensory resources, and when to stop observing, by estimating its perceptual space.

NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2015.11.002,Accurate sensorless lead-through programming for lightweight robots in structured environments,"Nowadays, programming an industrial manipulator is a complex and time-consuming activity, and this prevents industrial robots from being massively used in companies characterized by high production flexibility and rapidly changing products. The introduction of sensor-based lead-through programming approaches (where the operator manually guides the robot to teach new positions), instead, allows to increase the speed and reduce the complexity of the programming phase, yielding an effective solution to enhance flexibility. Nevertheless, some drawbacks arise, like for instance lack of accuracy, need to ensure the human operator safety, and need for force/torque sensors (the standard devices adopted for lead-through programming) that are expensive, fragile and difficult to integrate in the robot controller. This paper presents a novel approach to lead-through robot programming. The proposed strategy does not rely on dedicated hardware since torques due to operator's forces are estimated using a model-based observer fed with joint position, joint velocity and motor current measures. On the basis of this information, the external forces applied to the manipulator are reconstructed. A voting system identifies the largest Cartesian component of the force/torque applied to the manipulator in order to obtain accurate lead-through programming via admittance control. Finally an optimization stage is introduced in order to track the joint position displacements computed by the admittance filter as much as possible, while enforcing obstacle avoidance constraints, actuation bounds and Tool Centre Point (TCP) operational space velocity limits. The proposed approach has been implemented and experimentally tested on an ABB dual-arm concept robot FRIDA.",ar,2016-06-01,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,Lead-through | Robot programming | Robot teaching | Safety | Sensorless,2-s2.0-84949644531,S073658451500126X,,Article,Ragaglia M.,60023256,Politecnico di Milano,Milan,Italy,4,"Ragaglia, Matteo;Zanchettin, Andrea Maria;Bascetta, Luca;Rocco, Paolo",56414883000;27268100300;14029685500;57216880234,60023256;60023256;60023256;60023256,1 June 2016,7365845,18080,,Journal,39,,,9-21,0,,undefined,,28,2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073658451500126X?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1007/s10994-016-5558-8,Probabilistic logic programming for hybrid relational domains,"We introduce a probabilistic language and an efficient inference algorithm based on distributional clauses for static and dynamic inference in hybrid relational domains. Static inference is based on sampling, where the samples represent (partial) worlds (with discrete and continuous variables). Furthermore, we use backward reasoning to determine which facts should be included in the partial worlds. For filtering in dynamic models we combine the static inference algorithm with particle filters and guarantee that the previous partial samples can be safely forgotten, a condition that does not hold in most logical filtering frameworks. Experiments show that the proposed framework can outperform classic sampling methods for static and dynamic inference and that it is promising for robotics and vision applications. In addition, it provides the correct results in domains in which most probabilistic programming languages fail.",ar,2016-06-01,Machine Learning,Discrete and continuous distributions | Likelihood weighting | Logic programming | Particle filter | Probabilistic programming | Statistical relational learning,2-s2.0-84964262606,,,Article,Nitti D.,60025063,KU Leuven,3000 Leuven,Belgium,3,"Nitti, Davide;De Laet, Tinne;De Raedt, Luc",57197292386;15761675700;55760010700,60025063;60025063;60025063,1 June 2016,8856125,24775,15730565,Journal,103,3,,407-449,1,IWT,undefined,Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie,20,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-016-5558-8,,Excluido por nada que ver (logic programming)
NO,10.1016/j.swevo.2015.10.011,A hybridization of an improved particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm for multi-robot path planning,"This paper proposed a new methodology to determine the optimal trajectory of the path for multi-robot in a clutter environment using hybridization of improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) with an improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA). The proposed approach embedded the social essence of IPSO with motion mechanism of IGSA. The proposed hybridization IPSO–IGSA maintain the efficient balance between exploration and exploitation because of adopting co-evolutionary techniques to update the IGSA acceleration and particle positions with IPSO velocity simultaneously. The objective of the algorithm is to minimize the maximum path length that corresponds to minimize the arrival time of all robots to their respective destination in the environment. The robot on the team make independent decisions, coordinate, and cooperate with each other to determine the next positions from their current position in the world map using proposed hybrid IPSO–IGSA. Finally the analytical and experimental results of the multi-robot path planning were compared to those obtained by IPSO–IGSA, IPSO, IGSA in a similar environment.

NO,10.1002/cta.2159,Development of numerical linear algebra algorithms in dynamic fixed-point format: A case study of Lanczos tridiagonalization,"Proper range and precision analysis play an important role in the development of fixed-point algorithms for embedded system applications. Numerical linear algebra algorithms used to find singular value decomposition of symmetric matrices are suitable for signal and image-processing applications. These algorithms have not been attempted much in fixed-point arithmetic. The reason is wide dynamic range of data and vulnerability of the algorithms to round-off errors. For any real-time application, the range of the input matrix may change frequently. This poses difficulty for constant and variable fixed-point formats to decide on integer wordlengths during float-to-fixed conversion process because these formats involve determination of integer wordlengths before the compilation of the program. Thus, these formats may not guarantee to avoid overflow for all ranges of input matrices. To circumvent this problem, a novel dynamic fixed-point format has been proposed to compute integer wordlengths adaptively during runtime. Lanczos algorithm with partial orthogonalization, which is a tridiagonalization step in computation of singular value decomposition of symmetric matrices, has been taken up as a case study. The fixed-point Lanczos algorithm is tested for matrices with different dimensions and condition numbers along with image covariance matrix. The accuracy of fixed-point Lanczos algorithm in three different formats has been compared on the basis of signal-to-quantization-noise-ratio, number of accurate fractional bits, orthogonality and factorization errors. Results show that dynamic fixed-point format either outperforms or performs on par with constant and variable formats. Determination of fractional wordlengths requires minimization of hardware cost subject to accuracy constraint. In this context, we propose an analytical framework for deriving mean-square-error or quantization noise power among Lanczos vectors, which can serve as an accuracy constraint for wordlength optimization. Error is found to propagate through different arithmetic operations and finally accumulate in the last Lanczos vector. It is observed that variable and dynamic fixed-point formats produce vectors with lesser round-off error than constant format. All the three fixed-point formats of Lanczos algorithm have been synthesized on Virtex 7 field-programmable gate array using Vivado high-level synthesis design tool. A comparative study of resource usage and power consumption is carried out.",ar,2016-06-01,International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications,accuracy evaluation | fixed-point arithmetic | Lanczos algorithm | mean-square-error | signal-to-quantization-noise-ratio | singular value decomposition,2-s2.0-84971668369,,,Article,Pradhan T.,60004750,Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur,Kharagpur,India,4,"Pradhan, Tapan;Kabi, Bibek;Mohanty, Ramanarayan;Routray, Aurobinda",36139185300;37011143600;55212000900;55927861800,60004750;60004750;60004750;60004750,1 June 2016,989886,17963,1097007X,Journal,44,6,,1222-1262,0,,undefined,,3,2016,https://doi.org/10.1002/cta.2159,,Excluido por nada que ver
NO,10.1145/2928270,COBAYN: Compiler autotuning framework using Bayesian networks,"The variety of today's architectures forces programmers to spend a great deal of time porting and tuning application codes across different platforms. Compilers themselves need additional tuning, which has considerable complexity as the standard optimization levels, usually designed for the average case and the specific target architecture, often fail to bring the best results. This article proposes COBAYN: Compiler autotuning framework using Bayesian Networks, an approach for a compiler autotuning methodology using machine learning to speed up application performance and to reduce the cost of the compiler optimization phases. The proposed framework is based on the application characterization done dynamically by using independent microarchitecture features and Bayesian networks. The article also presents an evaluation based on using static analysis and hybrid feature collection approaches. In addition, the article compares Bayesian networks with respect to several state-of-the-art machine-learning models. Experiments were carried out on an ARM embedded platform and GCC compiler by considering two benchmark suites with 39 applications. The set of compiler configurations, selected by the model (less than 7% of the search space), demonstrated an application performance speedup of up to 4.6× on Polybench (1.85× on average) and 3.1× on cBench (1.54× on average) with respect to standard optimization levels. Moreover, the comparison of the proposed technique with (i) random iterative compilation, (ii) machine learning-based iterative compilation, and (iii) noniterative predictive modeling techniques shows, on average, 1.2×, 1.37×, and 1.48×speedup, respectively. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates 4×and 3×speedup, respectively, on cBench and Polybench in terms of exploration efficiency given the same quality of the solutions generated by the random iterative compilation model.",ar,2016-06-01,ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization,Bayesian networks | Design space exploration | Statistical inference,2-s2.0-84975506485,,,Article,Ashouri A.H.,60023004;60011048;60006164;116878711,University of Delaware;IBM Research;Los Alamos National Laboratory;DEIB,Newark;Yorktown Heights;Los Alamos;Milan,United States;United States;United States;Italy,6,"Ashouri, Amir Hossein;Mariani, Giovanni;Palermo, Gianluca;Park, Eunjung;Cavazos, John;Silvano, Cristina",56135215900;17334987700;7101655840;21743833400;14033774900;6701431625,116878711;60011048;116878711;60006164;60023004;116878711,June 2016,15443566,12100154406,15443973,Journal,13,2,21,,1,H2020,671623,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,44,2016,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2928270,,Excluido por nada que ver

NO,10.3390/s16081195,Applying high-speed vision sensing to an industrial robot for high-performance position regulation under uncertainties,"It is traditionally difficult to implement fast and accurate position regulation on an industrial robot in the presence of uncertainties. The uncertain factors can be attributed either to the industrial robot itself (e.g., a mismatch of dynamics, mechanical defects such as backlash, etc.) or to the external environment (e.g., calibration errors, misalignment or perturbations of a workpiece, etc.). This paper proposes a systematic approach to implement high-performance position regulation under uncertainties on a general industrial robot (referred to as the main robot) with minimal or no manual teaching. The method is based on a coarse-to-fine strategy that involves configuring an add-on module for the main robot’s end effector. The add-on module consists of a 1000 Hz vision sensor and a high-speed actuator to compensate for accumulated uncertainties. The main robot only focuses on fast and coarse motion, with its trajectories automatically planned by image information from a static low-cost camera. Fast and accurate peg-and-hole alignment in one dimension was implemented as an application scenario by using a commercial parallel-link robot and an add-on compensation module with one degree of freedom (DoF). Experimental results yielded an almost 100% success rate for fast peg-in-hole manipulation (with regulation accuracy at about 0.1 mm) when the workpiece was randomly placed.",ar,2016-07-29,Sensors (Switzerland),Add-on module | Compensation of uncertainties | Dynamic compensation | Fast and accurate robotic position regulation | High-speed vision sensing | Industrial robots,2-s2.0-84979935488,,,Article,Huang S.,60025272,The University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,5,"Huang, Shouren;Bergström, Niklas;Yamakawa, Yuji;Senoo, Taku;Ishikawa, Masatoshi",55657596400;7006164011;10041787100;7004786076;7404031178,60025272;60025272;60025272;60025272;60025272,29 July 2016,14248220,130124,,Journal,16,8,1195,,1,JSPS,24220005,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,13,2016,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/8/1195,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1007/s10846-016-0371-y,Experience-Based Planning Domains: an Integrated Learning and Deliberation Approach for Intelligent Robots: Robot Task Learning from Human Instructions,"Deliberation and learning are required to endow a robot with the capabilities for acquiring knowledge, performing a variety of tasks and interactions, and adapting to open-ended environments. This paper presents the notion of experience-based planning domains (EBPDs) for task level learning and planning in robotics. EBPDs provide methods for a robot to: (i) obtain robot activity experiences from the robot’s performance in a dynamic environment; (ii) conceptualize each experience producing an activity schema; and (iii) exploit the learned activity schemata to make plans in similar situations. Experiences are episodic descriptions of plan-based robot activities including environment perception, sequences of applied actions and achieved tasks.

NO,10.1016/j.neucom.2016.05.057,A hybrid improved PSO-DV algorithm for multi-robot path planning in a clutter environment,"This paper proposed a novel approach to determine the optimal trajectory of the path for multi-robots in a clutter environment using hybridization of improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) with differentially perturbed velocity (DV) algorithm. The objective of the algorithm is to minimize the maximum path length that corresponds to minimize the arrival time of all the robots to their respective destination in the environment. The robots on the team make independent decisions, coordinate, and cooperate with each other to determine the next positions from their current position in the world map using proposed hybrid IPSO-DV. The proposed scheme adjusts the velocity of the robots by incorporating a vector differential operator inherited from Differential Evolution (DE) in IPSO. Finally the analytical and experimental results of the multi-robot path planning have been compared to those obtained by IPSO-DV, IPSO, DE in a similar environment. Simulation and khepera environment results are compared with those obtained by IPSO-DV to ensure the integrity of the algorithm. The results obtained from Simulation as well as Khepera environment reveal that, the proposed IPSO-DV performs better than IPSO and DE with respect to optimal trajectory path length and arrival time.",ar,2016-09-26,Neurocomputing,Average path Length | Average total trajectory path deviation | Average untraveled trajectory target distance | IPSO-DV | Multi-robot path planning,2-s2.0-85008394491,S0925231216304945,,Article,Das P.K.,60079452;60071276;60032730;60024948;60001808,"Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar;VSS University of Technology;Indian Institute of Technology Delhi;Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata;BPUT, College of Engineering &amp; Technology",Odisha;Sambalpur;New Delhi;Kolkata;Bhubaneswar,India;India;India;India;India,6,"Das, P.

NO,10.1007/s10514-015-9502-8,Human–robot planning and learning for marine data collection,We propose an integrated learning and planning framework that leverages knowledge from a human user along with prior information about the environment to generate trajectories for scientific data collection in marine environments. The proposed framework combines principles from probabilistic planning with nonparametric uncertainty modeling to refine trajectories for execution by autonomous vehicles. These trajectories are informed by a utility function learned from the human operator’s implicit preferences using a modified coactive learning algorithm. The resulting techniques allow for user-specified trajectories to be modified for reduced risk of collision and increased reliability. We test our approach in two marine monitoring domains and show that the proposed framework mimics human-planned trajectories while also reducing the risk of operation. This work provides insight into the tools necessary for combining human input with vehicle navigation to provide persistent autonomy.,ar,2016-10-01,Autonomous Robots,Adaptive planning | Coactive learning | Informative path planning | Marine robotics,2-s2.0-84944541766,,,Article,Somers T.,60013402,Oregon State University,Corvallis,United States,2,"Somers, Thane;Hollinger, Geoffrey A.",56577814000;23008589200,60013402;60013402,1 October 2016,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,40,7,,1123-1137,0,NSF,IIS-1317815,National Science Foundation,19,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-015-9502-8,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

Traditional motion planning strategies rely on pre-planned optimal trajectories and feedback control techniques. The proposed learning agent approach enjoys a direct model-free methodology that enables the robot to function in dynamic and/or partially observable environments. The agent uses a set of guard-action rules that determines the motion inputs at each step. Using a number of control inputs (actions) and the developed RL scheme, the agent learns to make near-optimal moves in response to the incoming position/orientation signals. The proposed method employs an improved variant of the XCS as its learning agent. Results of several simulated experiments for the spherical robot show that this approach is capable of planning a near-optimal path to a predefined target from any given position/orientation.",ar,2016-10-01,Applied Intelligence,Extended classifier system | Reinforcement learning | Robot motion planning | Spherical mobile robot,2-s2.0-84964270642,,,Article,Roozegar M.,60022927;60002494,University of Tehran;Université McGill,Tehran;Montreal,Iran;Canada,4,"Roozegar, M.;Mahjoob, M.

NO,10.1177/1729881416664078,Planning with ants,"Rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) have been proven to be efficient for planning in environments populated with obstacles. These methods perform a uniform sampling of the state space, which is needed to guarantee the algorithm's completeness but does not necessarily lead to the most efficient solution. In previous works it has been shown that the use of heuristics to modify the sampling strategy could incur an improvement in the algorithm performance. However, these heuristics only apply to solve the shortest path-planning problem. Here we propose a framework that allows us to incorporate arbitrary heuristics to modify the sampling strategy according to the user requirements. This framework is based on 'learning from experience'. Specifically, we introduce a utility function that takes the contribution of the samples to the tree construction into account; sampling at locations of increased utility then becomes more frequent. The idea is realized by introducing an ant colony optimization concept in the RRT/RRT∗ algorithm and defining a novel utility function that permits trading off exploitation versus exploration of the state space. We also extend the algorithm to allow an anytime implementation. The scheme is validated with three scenarios: one populated with multiple rectangular obstacles, one consisting of a single narrow passage and a maze-like environment. We evaluate its performance in terms of the cost and time to find the first path, and in terms of the evolution of the path quality with the number of iterations. It is shown that the proposed algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art RRT and RRT∗ algorithms.",ar,2016-10-07,International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems,ant colony optimization | autonomous agents | bio-inspired robotics | Mobile robots | motion and path planning | rapidly exploring random trees,2-s2.0-84992602677,,,Article,Viseras A.,60030114;60007798,"Universidad Pablo de Olavide, de Sevilla;Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- Und Raumfahrt",Sevilla; Cologne,Spain;Germany,3,"Viseras, Alberto;Losada, Rafael Ortiz;Merino, Luis",57190122619;57191738493;7003946345,60007798;60007798;60030114,7 October 2016,17298806,144749,17298814,Journal,13,5,,1-16,1,EC,611153 TERESA,European Commission,18,2016,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1729881416664078,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.2200/S00728ED1V01Y201608DCS051,Embedded Systems Design with the Texas Instruments MSP432 32-bit Processor,"This book provides a thorough introduction to the Texas Instruments MPS432™ microcontroller. The MPS432 is a 32-bit processor with the ARM Cortex M4F architecture and a built-in floating point unit. At the core, the MSP432 features a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F CPU, a RISC-Architecture processing unit that includes a built-in DSP engine and a floating point unit. As an extension of the ultra-low-power MSP microcontroller family, the MSP432 features ultra-low power consumption and integrated digital and analog hardware peripherals. The MSP432 is a new member to the MSP family. It provides for a seamless transition to applications requiring 32-bit processing at an operating frequency of up to 48 MHz. The processor may be programmed at a variety of levels with different programming languages including the user-friendly Energia rapid prototyping platform, in assembly language, and in C. A number of C programming options are also available to developers, starting with register-level access code where developers can directly configure the device's registers, to Driver Library, which provides a standardized set of application program interfaces (APIs) that enable software developers to quickly manipulate various peripherals available on the device. Even higher abstraction layers are also available, such as the extremely user-friendly Energia platform, that enables even beginners to quickly prototype an application on MSP432. The MSP432 LaunchPad is supported by a host of technical data, application notes, training modules, and software examples. All are encapsulated inside one handy package called MSPWare, available as both a stand-Alone download package as well as on the TI Cloud development site: dev.ti.com The features of the MSP432 may be extended with a full line of BoosterPack plug-in modules. The MSP432 is also supported by a variety of third party modular sensors and software compiler companies. In the back, a thorough introduction to the MPS432 line of microcontrollers, programming techniques, and interface concepts are provided along with considerable tutorial information with many illustrated examples. Each chapter provides laboratory exercises to apply what has been presented in the chapter. The book is intended for an upper level undergraduate course in microcontrollers or mechatronics but may also be used as a reference for capstone design projects. Practicing engineers already familiar with another microcontroller, who require a quick tutorial on the microcontroller, will also find this book very useful. Finally, middle school and high school students will find the MSP432 highly approachable via the Energia rapid prototyping system.

NO,10.1007/s00165-016-0382-2,Model checking learning agent systems using Promela with embedded C code and abstraction,"As autonomous systems become more prevalent, methods for their verification will become more widely used. Model checking is a formal verification technique that can help ensure the safety of autonomous systems, but in most cases it cannot be applied by novices, or in its straight “off-the-shelf” form. In order to be more widely applicable it is crucial that more sophisticated techniques are used, and are presented in a way that is reproducible by engineers and verifiers alike. In this paper we demonstrate in detail two techniques that are used to increase the power of model checking using the model checker Spin. The first of these is the use of embedded C code within Promela specifications, in order to accurately reflect robot movement. The second is to use abstraction together with a simulation relation to allow us to verify multiple environments simultaneously. We apply these techniques to a fairly simple system in which a robot moves about a fixed circular environment and learns to avoid obstacles. The learning algorithm is inspired by the way that insects learn to avoid obstacles in response to pain signals received from their antennae. Crucially, we prove that our abstraction is sound for our example system—a step that is often omitted but is vital if formal verification is to be widely accepted as a useful and meaningful approach.",ar,2016-11-01,Formal Aspects of Computing,abstraction | Agent | Learning | Model checking | Simulation,2-s2.0-84976316418,,,Article,Kirwan R.,60001490,University of Glasgow,Glasgow,United Kingdom,3,"Kirwan, Ryan;Miller, Alice;Porr, Bernd",55922847500;56925820600;6602199002,60001490;60001490;60001490,1 November 2016,9345043,24980,1433299X,Journal,28,6,,1027-1056,1,EPSRC,EP/P504937/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,1,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00165-016-0382-2,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.scico.2016.03.009,Model-driven processes and tools to design robot-based generative learning objects for computer science education,"In this paper, we introduce a methodology to design robot-oriented generative learning objects (GLOs) that are, in fact, heterogeneous meta-programs to teach computer science (CS) topics such as programming. The methodology includes CS learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the SW engineering domain. Firstly, we define the CS learning domain using the known educational framework TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the CS learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The GLO design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design GLOs manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the GLO design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of GLOs themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented GLOs as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented GLOs and their supporting tools.",ar,2016-11-01,Science of Computer Programming,Educational robots | Feature models | Generative learning objects (GLOs) | GLO design tool | Model transformation,2-s2.0-84971228847,S0167642316300247,,Article,Štuikys V.,60042282,Kaunas University of Technology,Kaunas,Lithuania,4,"Štuikys, Vytautas;Burbaitė, Renata;Bespalova, Kristina;Ziberkas, Giedrius",6603106159;54897970900;54897972900;6506314105,60042282;60042282;60042282;60042282,1 November 2016,1676423,28416,,Journal,129,,,48-71,1,,undefined,,15,2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642316300247?via%3Dihub,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bmx42aJDE-4xQPJYWqeAMKaoQ1HH_Uqv/view?usp=sharing,"Model-driven?

Generative Reuse Model: Se basa en la idea de reutilizar procesos en lugar de ""componentes"". Por ejemplo, parsers o generadores de código. El proceso de generación es el que se reutiliza en distintos contextos para generar el producto final. En cambio en un modelo basado en componentes, se reutilizan casi sin cambiar componentes pre-programados.

En este paper plantean la idea de Generative Learning Objects (GLO), y por lo que entiendo ""generan"" de alguna forma los Learning Objects (LO) que después usan para enseñar. No entiendo bien qué serían estos GLO y LO.
Ok,  por lo visto los LOs. generados están expresados en un ""target language"", que en este caso sería un lenguaje específico de programación de robots: RobotC, Lejos, etc. Esencialmente, un LO sería un programa para controlar un robot, que se baja a la memoria del robot y este lo ejecuta...

""Indeed, the concepts and technologies we use are borrowed from software en-
gineering [...] and are therefore sound"" jajaja

Esta gente de model-driven software engineering bla bla bla está medio obsesionada con la reusabilidad... pareciera que mucho no les gusta escribir código.

En 5.4 muestran un ejemplo de modelos y generación de código. Según entendí, es el profesor el encargado de definir los modelos (o bajar de algún repositorio y adaptar si fuera necesario). Luego los estudiantes son los que usan el GLO y hacen la derivación a código concreto que el robot puede ejecutar. Lo que no entiendo es qué se aprende en este proceso. Y tampoco entiendo cuál es la gracia, los modelos que muestran parecen mucho más complejos que el código generado al final. Ni hablar que el código que muestran en PHP que hace la generación es un asco, básicamente concatenación de strings y rezar... Terrible.

En la sección 7 muestran el caso de estudio usando LegoNxt y RobotC, capaz tenga algo de sentido...
Hasta donde entendí del ejemplo, ¿la idea es que los alumnos interactúen modificando los parámetros del GLO y derivando código y viendo cómo cambia el comportamiento? No creo que cumpla con el requisito de que los alumnos PROGRAMEN robots así que lo voy a poner en NO.

Capaz convendría darle a Claudia el paper y pedirle que me explique las dudas..."

The proposed system consists of a desktop augmented reality setup where users operate a haptic device for object interaction. Users of the haptic device are not co-located with the environment where real objects are present. A three degrees of freedom haptic device, providing force feedback, is adopted for object interaction by pushing, selection, translation and rotation. The system also supports physics-based animation of rigid bodies. Virtual objects are simulated in a physically plausible manner and seem to coexist with real objects in the augmented reality space. Algorithms for calibration, object recognition, registration and haptic rendering have been developed. Automatic model-based object recognition and registration are performed from 3D range data acquired by a moving laser scanner mounted on a robot arm. Several experiments have been performed to evaluate the augmented reality system in both single-user and collaborative tasks. Moreover, the potential of the system for programming robot manipulation tasks by demonstration is investigated. Experiments show that a precedence graph, encoding the sequential structure of the task, can be successfully extracted from multiple user demonstrations and that the learned task can be executed by a robot system.",ar,2016-11-01,Multimedia Systems,Collaborative manipulation | Programming by demonstration | Visuo-haptic augmented reality,2-s2.0-84945242984,,,Article,Aleotti J.,60004969,Università di Parma,Parma,Italy,3,"Aleotti, Jacopo;Micconi, Giorgio;Caselli, Stefano",23026542300;56440206700;7004694361,60004969;60004969;60004969,1 November 2016,9424962,25626,,Journal,22,6,,675-691,0,CNR,undefined,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,7,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00530-015-0488-z,,Excluido por no educación

First, the RSK model, which imitates the representation of environments in the human brain, is presented to describe the search environments. The environments that are divided into regions are represented by a hierarchical nested structure where small regions are grouped together to form superordinate regions. Second, on the basis of the RSK model, an FTC-A∗ search algorithm is developed to plan the fine-to-coarse route. By making a fine planning to robot surroundings in vicinity, but a coarse planning to that at the distance, the FTC-A∗ algorithm can effectively reduce computational complexity, so as to enhance the efficiency of route search, and meanwhile makes robots to react quickly to user's commands, especially in large-scale environments.

NO,10.1109/MCS.2016.2602090,Measurable Augmented Reality for Prototyping Cyberphysical Systems: A Robotics Platform to Aid the Hardware Prototyping and Performance Testing of Algorithms,"Planning, control, perception, and learning are current research challenges in multirobot systems. The transition dynamics of the robots may be unknown or stochastic, making it difficult to select the best action each robot must take at a given time. The observation model, a function of the robots' sensor systems, may be noisy or partial, meaning that deterministic knowledge of the team's state is often impossible to attain. Moreover, the actions each robot can take may have an associated success rate and/or a probabilistic completion time. Robots designed for real-world applications require careful consideration of such sources of uncertainty, regardless of the control scheme or planning or learning algorithms used for a specific problem. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of planning algorithms can be challenging due to the latent variables they often operate on. When performance testing such algorithms on hardware, the simultaneous use of the debugging and visualization tools available on a workstation can be difficult. This transition from experimentation to implementation becomes especially challenging when the experiments need to replicate some feature of the software tool set in hardware, such as simulation of visually complex environments. This article details a robotics prototyping platform, called measurable augmented reality for prototyping cyberphysical systems (MAR-CPS), that directly addresses this problem, allowing for the real-time visualization of latent state information to aid hardware prototyping and performance testing of algorithms.",ar,2016-12-01,IEEE Control Systems,,2-s2.0-85011961527,,,Article,Omidshafiei S.,60030821;60022195;60022002;60013301;101111207,Boeing Corporation;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi;Qualcomm Incorporated;Scalable Display Technologies,Chicago;Cambridge;Istanbul;San Diego;Cambridge (ex Galt),United States;United States;Turkey;United States;United States,9,"Omidshafiei, Shayegan;Agha-Mohammadi, Ali Akbar;Chen, Yu Fan;Ure, Nazim Kemal;Liu, Shih Yuan;Lopez, Brett T.;Surati, Rajeev;How, Jonathan P.;Vian, John",56423756100;54792649700;55837903100;34882521500;57113982000;57117251000;6507292007;7006512768;7003311245,60022195;60013301;60022195;60022002;60022195;60022195;101111207;60022195;60030821,December 2016,1066033X,21100239264,,Journal,36,6,7740990,65-87,0,,undefined,,11,2016,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7740990,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.artint.2016.07.004,"A synthesis of automated planning and reinforcement learning for efficient, robust decision-making","Automated planning and reinforcement learning are characterized by complementary views on decision making: the former relies on previous knowledge and computation, while the latter on interaction with the world, and experience. Planning allows robots to carry out different tasks in the same domain, without the need to acquire knowledge about each one of them, but relies strongly on the accuracy of the model. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, does not require previous knowledge, and allows robots to robustly adapt to the environment, but often necessitates an infeasible amount of experience. We present Domain Approximation for Reinforcement LearnING (DARLING), a method that takes advantage of planning to constrain the behavior of the agent to reasonable choices, and of reinforcement learning to adapt to the environment, and increase the reliability of the decision making process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a service robot, carrying out a variety of tasks in an office building. We find that when the robot makes decisions by planning alone on a given model it often fails, and when it makes decisions by reinforcement learning alone it often cannot complete its tasks in a reasonable amount of time. When employing DARLING, even when seeded with the same model that was used for planning alone, however, the robot can quickly learn a behavior to carry out all the tasks, improves over time, and adapts to the environment as it changes.",ar,2016-12-01,Artificial Intelligence,Answer set programming | Automated planning | Autonomous robot | Reinforcement learning | Robot learning,2-s2.0-84988493689,S0004370216300819,,Article,Leonetti M.,60032350;60013372;60012070,Sapienza Università di Roma;The University of Texas at Austin;University of Leeds,Rome;Austin;Leeds,Italy;United States;United Kingdom,3,"Leonetti, Matteo;Iocchi, Luca;Stone, Peter",36802120200;6602922345;7203001213,60013372-60012070;60032350;60013372,1 December 2016,43702,23675,,Journal,241,,,103-130,1,NSF,1305287,National Science Foundation,40,2016,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370216300819?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1109/TSMC.2016.2531656,Interactive Teachable Cognitive Agents: Smart Building Blocks for Multiagent Systems,"Developing a complex intelligent system by abstracting their behaviors, functionalities, and reasoning mechanisms can be tedious and time consuming. In this paper, we present a framework for developing an application or software system based on smart autonomous components that collaborate with the developer or user to realize the entire system. Inspired by teachable approaches and programming-by-demonstration methods in robotics and end-user development, we treat intelligent agents as teachable components that make up the system to be built. Each agent serves different functionalities and may have prebuilt operations to accomplish its own design objectives. However, each agent may also be equipped with in-built social-cognitive traits to interact with the user or other agents in order to adapt its own operations, objectives, and relationships with others. The results of adaptation can be in the form of groups or multiagent systems as new aggregated components. This approach is made to tackle the difficulties in completely programming the entire system by allowing the user to teach the components toward the desired behaviors in the situated context of the application.

The notable characteristic of affordance-based perception is that an object is perceived by what it affords (e.g., graspable and rollable), instead of identities (e.g., name, color, and shape). Affordances play an important role in basic robot capabilities such as recognition, planning, and prediction. The key challenges in affordance research are: 1) how to automatically discover the distinctive features that specify an affordance in an online and incremental manner and 2) how to generalize these features to novel environments. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers, including: 1) a general overview; 2) classification and critical analysis of existing work; 3) discussion of how affordances are useful in developmental robotics; 4) some open questions about how to use the affordance concept; and 5) a few promising research directions.",ar,2016-12-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,Affordance | autonomous mental development (AMD) | developmental robotics | embodied intelligence (EI) | infant learning | intrinsic motivation,2-s2.0-85006279499,,,Article,Min H.,60024542;60008576,South China University of Technology;Foshan University,Guangzhou;Foshan,China;China,5,"Min, Huaqing;Yi, Chang'an;Luo, Ronghua;Zhu, Jinhui;Bi, Sheng",7102292458;50362183500;7202671129;8260688400;57202658984,60024542;60008576;60024542;60024542;60024542,December 2016,23798920,21100784665,23798939,Journal,8,4,7582380,237-255,0,NSFC,61203310,National Natural Science Foundation of China,54,2016,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7582380,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

And then, due to the random selection of weight and threshold parameters, it also proposes an extreme learning machine algorithm optimized by particle swarm (PSO-ELM algorithm) in this paper. Firstly, Q-OSELM algorithm obtains current environment and the status information of the robot through the characteristic of reinforcement learning, which combines dynamic network with supervised learning. After that, the online sequential extreme learning machine is used to approximate the function of the current status to get the rewards and punishments of the current status; Secondly, it is used to solve the problem of slow training speed by the characteristic of less parameter settings and better generalization performance. PSO-ELM algorithm is used to optimize the input weights and the hidden layer bias of the extreme learning machine which have been seen as the particle of particle swarm optimization algorithm to improve the network structure of the extreme learning machine. It could overcome inaccuracy of traditional extreme learning machine through particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, the performance of two learning algorithms is verified. The simulation experimental results show that the Q-OSELM learning algorithm improves the initiative of machine learning.

However, traditional virtualization systems can not effectively isolate shared micro architectural resources among virtual machines (VMs) running on multicore systems. CPU and memory intensive VMs contending for these resources will lead to serious performance interference, which makes virtualization systems less efficient and VM performance less stable. In this paper, we propose a contention-aware performance prediction model on the virtualized multicore systems to quantify the performance degradation of VMs. First, we identify the performance interference factors and design synthetic micro-benchmarks to obtain VM's contention sensitivity and intensity features that are correlated with VM performance degradation. Second, based on the contention features, we build VM performance prediction model using machine learning techniques to quantify the precise levels of performance degradation. The proposed model can be used to optimize VM performance on multicore systems. Our experimental results show that the performance prediction model achieves high accuracy and the mean absolute error is 2.83%.",ar,2017-01-01,Journal of Systems Architecture,Multicore | Performance prediction | Resource contention | Virtual machine,2-s2.0-85003674335,S1383762116300649,,Article,Cheng Y.,60018805;60003970,Deakin University;Zhejiang University,Geelong;Hangzhou,Australia;China,4,"Cheng, Yuxia;Chen, Wenzhi;Wang, Zonghui;Xiang, Yang",56017910200;55716067600;7410047051;57198411608,60003970;60003970;60003970;60003970-60018805,1 January 2017,13837621,12398,,Journal,72,,,42-50,0,,undefined,,10,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383762116300649?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por nada que ver

We formulate this control policy by a non-parametric potential function and a dissipative field, which both can be learned from human demonstrations. We show that the robot motion and its stiffness behaviors can be encapsulated by the potential function’s gradient and curvature, respectively. The dissipative field can also be used to model desired damping behavior throughout the motion, hence generating motions that follows the same velocity profile as the demonstrations. The proposed controller can be realized as a unification approach between “realtime motion generation” and “variable impedance control”, with the advantages that it has guaranteed stability as well as does not rely on following a reference trajectory. Our approach, called unified motion and variable impedance control (UMIC), is completely time-invariant and can be learned from a few demonstrations via solving two (convex) constrained quadratic optimization problems. We validate UMIC on a library of 30 human handwriting motions and on a set of experiments on 7-DoF KUKA light weight robot.",ar,2017-01-01,Autonomous Robots,Compliant control | Imitation learning | Motion control | Motion primitives | Physical interaction control | Potential field | Robot learning | Variable impedance control,2-s2.0-84950255908,,,Article,Khansari-Zadeh S.M.,60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,2,"Khansari-Zadeh, Seyed Mohammad;Khatib, Oussama",36463852000;7006484906,60012708;60012708,1 January 2017,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,41,1,,45-69,0,SNF,148957,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,33,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-015-9528-y,,Excluido por no educación

Several research results show that learning mobile robotics gives not only the ability to control certain types of robots but also develop many science-related attributes technical and social skills.

For this purpose we decided to develop a set of four exercises showing mobile robotics in the accessible and comprehensive way.

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2706943,A Branch History Directed Heuristic Search for Effective Binary Level Dynamic Symbolic Execution,"Heuristic search is an important part of modern dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) tools, as heuristic search can be used to effectively explore the large program input space. Searching task remains one of several research challenges due to the fact that the input space grows exponentially with the increase of program size, and different programs may have very different structures. The challenge is compounded in a cyber-physical system or cloud-based Internet of Things environment. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic search algorithm, which analyzes the program execution history and uses the refined history information to inform the search. This paper is based on the observation that the branch and input history generated during dynamic symbolic execution can help memorize the explored input space, and infer the partial structure of the program. With a summarized branch history, the proposed heuristic search makes informed (and better) decisions about which input area to search next for better efficiency. To evaluate the search algorithm, we implement the core DSE engine, integrated with modules to perform execution history collection and analysis. To make our method practical, we incorporate taint analysis and constraint solving statistics to guide the search algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that with the rich history information, the new search algorithm can explore the input space more effectively, thus resulting in detecting software defects faster.",ar,2017-01-01,IEEE Access,branch history | cyber-physical system | Dynamic symbolic execution | heuristic search | test case generation,2-s2.0-85028778247,,,Article,Hu Y.,60013614;60004538;60003212,Hangzhou Dianzi University;Dalian University of Technology;The University of Texas at San Antonio,Hangzhou;Dalian;San Antonio,China;China;United States,4,"Hu, Yan;Kong, Weiqiang;Ren, Yizhi;Choo, Kim Kwang Raymond",55641623000;15132228500;24537663900;57208540261,60004538;60004538;60013614;60003212,2017,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,5,,7932069,8752-8762,1,NSFC,61300017,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2,2017,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7932069,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1109/LRA.2016.2588584,Teaching Robots Generalizable Hierarchical Tasks Through Natural Language Instruction,"Natural language provides a convenient means of communicating information, and as such, is an ideal medium for enabling nonexpert users to teach robots novel tasks. However, in order to take advantage of natural language, a series of challenges must first be overcome. These challenges include the need to a) generalize learnt tasks to novel scenarios without retraining, b) resolve problems encountered during task execution, and c) derive implicit information from knowledge about the domain. To solve these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach to learning complex hierarchical tasks through natural language instruction, which not only allows learnt tasks to be generalized to novel situations without the need for retraining, but also enables an agent to derive implicit information from domain knowledge. Additionally, the approach presented in this paper enables the agent to infer task properties, such as preconditions and effects, directly from the explanation of the task flow. The authors validate the approach by demonstrating an implementation of the algorithms both on a simulated agent, as well as a Baxter robot. In each case, the agent is provided with a small set of primitive tasks for manipulating its workspace. From these primitives, the authors demonstrate the ability to teach the agent increasing complex tasks, including tasks of table cleaning, solely through natural language instructions.",ar,2017-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Autonomous agents | planning | scheduling and coordination | social human-robot interaction,2-s2.0-85057755759,,,Article,Suddrey G.,60011019,Queensland University of Technology,Brisbane,Australia,5,"Suddrey, Gavin;Lehnert, Christopher;Eich, Markus;Maire, Frederic;Roberts, Jonathan",57031893500;36463779100;26430801800;8889369300;8055301800,60011019;60011019;60011019;60011019;60011019,January 2017,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,2,1,7506292,201-208,0,ARC,undefined,Australian Research Council,5,2017,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7506292,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

NO,10.1177/0959651816677198,A real-time immune planning algorithm incorporating a specific immune mechanism for multi-robots in complex environments,"To solve the real-time path planning of multi-robots in complex environments, a new immune planning algorithm incorporating a specific immune mechanism is presented. In the immune planning algorithm incorporating a specific immune mechanism, a new coding format for an antibody is first defined according to the impact of the obstacle distribution on the obstacle avoidance behaviors of multi-robots. Then, a new robot immune dynamic model for antibody selection is designed in terms of different impacts of obstacles and targets on robot behaviors. Finally, aiming at the local minimum problem in complex environments and inspired by the specific immune mechanism, a series of appropriate avoidance behaviors are selected through the calculation of a specific immune mechanism to help robots walk out of local minima. In addition, to solve deadlock situations, a learning strategy for the antibody concentration is presented. Compared with four related immune planning algorithms - an improved artificial potential field, a rapidly exploring random tree algorithm, a D∗ algorithm and a A∗ algorithm - the simulation results in four static environments show that the paths planned by immune planning algorithm incorporating a specific immune mechanism are the shortest and the path smoothness is generally the highest, which shows its strong planning capability in multi-obstacle environments. The simulation result in a dynamic environment with local minima shows that the immune planning algorithm incorporating a specific immune mechanism has strong planning ability in dynamic obstacle avoidance and in escaping from local minima. Additionally, an experiment in a multi-robot environment shows that two robots can not only avoid static obstacles but also avoid dynamic obstacles, which further supports the validity of the proposed immune planning algorithm incorporating a specific immune mechanism for multi-robots in real environments.",ar,2017-01-01,Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

NO,10.1166/asl.2017.7714,C programming: Relevant exercises for engineering students using bloom’s taxonomy,"A program is a set of instructions that tell the computers how to accomplish a given task. C is one of the highlevel programming languages that is mostly used for system programming to write embedded system software that interact with hardware. Past assessments and random interviews showed that students from Foundation Engineering Program, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia face some difficulties in learning the concept of C programming. Therefore, this study was conducted to help the students in learning C programming. The objective of this paper is to frame out a set of C programming exercise using blooms taxonomy that suite with the students’ level. A quantitative research was carried out where by as many as 105 students were involved in answering questionnaires and creating their own set of questions on a specific chapter given. From the set of questions created by the students, it showed that most of the questions fall under the first four levels of bloom’s taxonomy which is remember, understanding, application and analysis. Thus, a set of exercise was framed out by implementing Bloom’s Taxonomy that accord with the student’s level. The new set of exercise was then answered by 82 students and their performance was evaluated to see whether the exercises are relevant to their level or not. Findings revealed that 75% of the scores fall above the first quartile (score = 59.64) which means the set of exercises is relevant to the students’ level because most of them were able to answer the exercises.",ar,2017-01-01,Advanced Science Letters,Bloom’s taxonomy | C Programming | Foundation students,2-s2.0-85021142017,,,Article,Abdul Rahman T.,60004351,Universiti Teknologi MARA,Shah Alam,Malaysia,1,"Abdul Rahman, Teh Faradilla Binti",56511269900,60004351,2017,19366612,19700181106,19367317,Journal,23,4,,2667-2670,0,,undefined,,0,2017,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asp/asl/2017/00000023/00000004/art00008,,Excluido por no robótica

NO,10.1016/j.asoc.2016.11.036,Learned Action SLAM: Sharing SLAM through learned path planning information between heterogeneous robotic platforms,"Currently when path planning is used in SLAM it is to benefit SLAM only, with no mutual benefit for path planning. Furthermore, SLAM algorithms are generally implemented and modified for individual heterogeneous robotic platforms without autonomous means of sharing navigation information. This limits the ability for robot platforms to share navigation information and can require heterogeneous robot platforms to generate individual maps within the same environment. This paper introduces Learned Action SLAM, which for the first time autonomously combines path-planning with SLAM such that heterogeneous robots can share learnt knowledge through Learning Classifier Systems (LCS). This is in contrast to Active SLAM, where path-planning is used to benefit SLAM only. Results from testing LA-SLAM on robots in the real world have shown; promise for use on teams of robots with various sensor morphologies, implications for scaling to associated domains, and ability to share maps taken from less capable to more advanced robots.",ar,2017-01-01,Applied Soft Computing Journal,Cognitive robotics | Learning Classifier Systems | Navigation | Simultaneous localisation and mapping,2-s2.0-85001950358,S1568494616306056,,Article,Williams H.,60002316,Victoria University of Wellington,Wellington,New Zealand,3,"Williams, Henry;Browne, Will N.;Carnegie, Dale A.",55369722800;17433255300;8983677200,60002316;60002316;60002316,1 January 2017,15684946,18136,,Journal,50,,,313-326,0,,undefined,,5,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494616306056?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1155/2017/1850678,Escaping Depressions in LRTS Based on Incremental Refinement of Encoded Quad-Trees,"In the context of robot navigation, game AI, and so on, real-time search is extensively used to undertake motion planning. Though it satisfies the requirement of quick response to users' commands and environmental changes, learning real-time search (LRTS) suffers from the heuristic depressions where agents behave irrationally. There have introduced several effective solutions, such as state abstractions. This paper combines LRTS and encoded quad-tree abstraction which represent the search space in multiresolutions. When exploring the environments, agents are enabled to locally repair the quad-tree models and incrementally refine the spatial cognition. By virtue of the idea of state aggregation and heuristic generalization, our EQ LRTS (encoded quad-tree based LRTS) possesses the ability of quickly escaping from heuristic depressions with less state revisitations. Experiments and analysis show that (a) our encoding principle for quad-trees is a much more memory-efficient method than other data structures expressing quad-trees, (b) EQ LRTS differs a lot in several characteristics from classical PR LRTS which represent the space and refine the paths hierarchically, and (c) EQ LRTS substantially reduces the planning amount and curtails heuristic updates compared with LRTS on uniform cells.",ar,2017-01-01,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,2-s2.0-85017144209,,,Article,Hu Y.,60024350,National University of Defense Technology,Changsha,China,4,"Hu, Yue;Qin, Long;Yin, Quanjun;Sun, Lin",57193845091;55175523200;23096547400;57072027700,60024350;60024350;60024350;60024350,2017,1024123X,13082,15635147,Journal,2017,,1850678,,1,NSFC,61473330,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2017,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2017/1850678/,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

In particular, a new interface to the model is presented, so-called “SimSphere-SOA” which forms a command line land biosphere tool, a Web Service interface and a parameters verification facade that offers a standardised environment for specification execution and result retrieval of a typical model simulation based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). SimSphere-SOA library can now execute various simulations in parallel. This allows exploitation of the tool in a simple and efficient way in comparison to the currently distributed approach. In SimSphere-SOA, an Application Programming Interface (API) is also provided to execute simulations that can be publicly consumed. Finally this API is exported as a Web Service for remotely executing simulations through web based tools. This way a simulation by the model can be executed efficiently and subsequently the model simulation outputs may be used in any kind of relevant analysis required.

In this method, information with driver driving the truck included the vehicle kinematics relations, and by repeat of the same process, the vehicle dynamics relationship would be clearer. This method reduced the complexity in process modeling. The fuzzy hyperbolic model could cleverly convert the coefficient matrix of the nonlinear system to a constant matrix, then neural networks as a supervised learning method could be used to identify the parameters, which made the model more closed to the true model and it would be convenient to design a control algorithm. Pole assignment as a classical control algorithm was simple and effective and it could be appropriately applied into this kind of model. Following steps were needed to establish the fuzzy tangent model and the pole assignment method. Initially, the sample data, including the lateral displacement error and orientation error, were collected through the driver controlling articulated vehicle at the speed of 3 m/s. During the multiple times of driving in the same roadway, little change could be achieved for the lateral displacement error and the orientation error. After that, by using the improved adaptive BP neural network model and the mediation rate of error estimator based on the method of Cauchy robust, the system error of neural network learning was effectively reduced, and the fitting error and relative error of data were decreased. So the system was better matched, and the weights were well identified. Finally, the pole assignment method with choosing the appropriate poles was designed to control articulate angle. The Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation platform was set up on the basis of PXI and C-RIO as a host computer. The kinematic model established in the Adams platform was downloaded into the PXI as the simulation plant, and the path tracking algorithm compiled by Simulink was embedded to the C-RIO as the real electronic control unit. The host computer coupled the vehicle model and the path tracking algorithm via the Labview platform and displayed the simulation status in the upper monitor. The results suggested in the process of driving this method could describe both the quantitative relation of the horizontal position deviation and course angle deviation with their rates of change, and could provide an accurate control. HIL results showed that the lateral displacement error, orientation error and the articulate angle of the vehicle were respectively controlled at 0.008 m, 0.07 rad (0.5°), 0.21 rad (12°). All the deviations were asymptotically stable. Overshoot and the response time were less than expectations and eventually stabilize. Articulated vehicles were maintained to the low level deviation and reference trajectory coincides with the track and also the simulation time and calculating time were all 80 s in the hardware in the loop simulation process, so the controller met the requirement of the real-time control performance. The method is demonstrated to be effective and reliable in path-tracking for the underground vehicles.",ar,2017-02-01,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,Algorithms | Hardware-in-the-loop | Models | Neural network | Path tracking | Pole placement method | Vehicles,2-s2.0-85017623690,,,Article,Yang J.,60018273,University of Science and Technology Beijing,Beijing,China,6,"Yang, Jue;Shi, Guangsi;Zhang, Wenming;Zhao, Xuan;Dun, Haiyang;Si, Jixiang",36449382600;57192166129;57202664198;57209163930;57193953741;57193951824,60018273;60018273;60018273;60018273;60018273;60018273,1 February 2017,10026819,62499,,Journal,33,,,78-84,0,,undefined,,2,2017,https://doi.org/10.11975/j.issn.1002-6819.2017.z1.012,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1109/TIE.2016.2613507,Episodic Memory-Based Robotic Planning under Uncertainty,"This paper presents a robotic behavior planning method under uncertainty based on biology-inspired episodic memory. Adaptive behavior planning, prediction and reasoning are achieved between tasks, environment, and threats. Through building a novel episode model and introducing the activation and stimulation mechanism of state neurons, the framework of an episodic memory-driving Markov decision process (EM-MDP) is proposed for incremental self-learning of robotic experience and cognitive behavior planning. Two main challenges in robot behavior control under uncertainty are addressed: high computational complexity and perceptual aliasing. The approach for robotic global planning and behaviors sequence prediction based on the EM-MDP is developed utilizing neuron synaptic potential. A local behavioral planning method based on risk function and feasible paths is employed to achieve path optimization and behavior reasoning under the condition of imperfect memory. Robot can evaluate the past events sequence, predict the current state, and plan the desired behaviors. The proposed method is evaluated in several real-life environments for a mobile robot system.

Head-pose estimation is challenging, because it must cope with changing illumination conditions, variabilities in face orientation and in appearance, partial occlusions of facial landmarks, as well as bounding-box-To-face alignment errors. We propose to use a mixture of linear regressions with partially-latent output. This regression method learns to map high-dimensional feature vectors (extracted from bounding boxes of faces) onto the joint space of head-pose angles and bounding-box shifts, such that they are robustly predicted in the presence of unobservable phenomena.

Mobile robots give access to a wide range of fields, such as complex mechanics, sensors, wireless transmission, mathematics, and computer science. However, despite their potential as educational tools, robots are still not as widespread in schools as they could be. In this article, we identify five key reasons: lack of diversity, high cost, noninclusive design, lack of educational material, and lack of stability over time. Then, we describe our answers to these problems, as we implemented them in the Thymio project: a mature mass-produced open-hardware robot, at a low price, with a multiage and gender-neutral feature set, and with a design promoting creativity, facilitating learning, and providing a wide range of interaction possibilities from built-in behaviors to text programming, passing through different visual programming environments. We highlight some neglected key issues that differentiate open-source hardware from open-source software, for instance the legal uncertainty of designing open hardware using professional computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the difficulty to distribute the development.

NO,10.1145/3014586,Configurable detection of SDC-causing errors in programs,"Silent Data Corruption (SDC) is a serious reliability issue in many domains, including embedded systems. However, current protection techniques are brittle and do not allow programmers to trade off performance for SDC coverage. Further, many require tens of thousands of fault-injection experiments, which are highly time- and resource-intensive. In this article, we propose two empirical models, SDCTune and SDCAuto, to predict the SDC proneness of a program's data. Both models are based on static and dynamic features of the program alone and do not require fault injections to be performed. The main difference between them is that SDCTune requires manual tuning while SDCAuto is completely automated, using machine-learning algorithms. We then develop an algorithm using both models to selectively protect the most SDC-prone data in the program subject to a given performance overhead bound. Our results show that both models are accurate at predicting the relative SDC rate of an application compared to fault injection, for a fraction of the time taken. Further, in terms of efficiency of detection (i.e., ratio of SDC coverage provided to performance overhead), our technique outperforms full duplication by a factor of 0.78x to 1.65x with the SDCTune model and 0.62x to 0.96x with SDCAuto model.",ar,2017-03-01,ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems,Compiler | Error detection | Fault tolerance | Modeling | Reliability,2-s2.0-85017269987,,,Article,Lu Q.,60017366;60010365,IBM Thomas J.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2017.2653850,Guiding Trajectory Optimization by Demonstrated Distributions,"Trajectory optimization is an essential tool for motion planning under multiple constraints of robotic manipulators. Optimization-based methods can explicitly optimize a trajectory by leveraging prior knowledge of the system and have been used in various applications such as collision avoidance. However, these methods often require a hand-coded cost function in order to achieve the desired behavior. Specifying such cost function for a complex desired behavior, e.g., disentangling a rope, is a nontrivial task that is often even infeasible. Learning from demonstration (LfD) methods offer an alternative way to program robot motion. LfD methods are less dependent on analytical models and instead learn the behavior of experts implicitly from the demonstrated trajectories. However, the problem of adapting the demonstrations to new situations, e.g., avoiding newly introduced obstacles, has not been fully investigated in the literature. In this letter, we present a motion planning framework that combines the advantages of optimization-based and demonstration-based methods. We learn a distribution of trajectories demonstrated by human experts and use it to guide the trajectory optimization process. The resulting trajectory maintains the demonstrated behaviors, which are essential to performing the task successfully, while adapting the trajectory to avoid obstacles.

NO,10.1016/j.engappai.2017.02.010,3Dana: A path planning algorithm for surface robotics,"Autonomous navigation is a research topic that has received considerable attention in robotics. Generally, it is a two step process: (i) generate a global route to the goal and (ii) local motion of the robot along the route. The focus of this paper is on the first part of the process. Some common techniques used are based on heuristic search algorithms that obtain (sub)optimal paths by usually exploiting a rather simplistic terrain representation. Then, the paths generated hardly take into account relevant terrain features, which leads to potentially unsafe paths in realistic environments. This paper presents two contributions: a mathematical formulation for any DTM that can be used by heuristic search algorithms, and a path planning algorithm that generates candidate paths that are safer than the ones obtained by previous approaches. This algorithm, called 3Dana, considers different parameters to maximize the path quality: the maximum slope allowed by the robot and the heading changes during the path. These constraints allow discarding infeasible paths while minimizing the heading changes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed, we present results for different scenarios, which include an evaluation of the algorithm in real Mars DTMs.",ar,2017-04-01,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,DTM | Path planning | Rover | Slope,2-s2.0-85013380311,S0952197617300337,,Article,Muñoz P.,60027800,Universidad de Alcalá,Alcala de Henares,Spain,3,"Muñoz, Pablo;R-Moreno, María D.;Castaño, Bonifacio",57193258537;6504593741;6507187998,60027800;60027800;60027800,1 April 2017,9521976,24182,,Journal,60,,,175-192,0,ESA,400010 6544/12/NL/PA,European Space Agency,15,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197617300337?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

The proposed approach builds a model by clustering appearance data using the newly proposed incremental nonparametric Bayesian clustering algorithm. The clusters are then classified as being either traversable or non-traversable. Because our approach effectively groups unknown regions with similar properties, while the vehicle is in motion without human intervention, the vehicle can be deployed to new environments by automatically adapting to changing environmental conditions.

NO,10.1007/s11370-017-0217-x,Path planning of modular robots on various terrains using Q-learning versus optimization algorithms,"Self-reconfigurable modular robots (SRMRs) have recently attracted considerable attention because of their numerous potential applications in the real world. In this paper, we draw a comprehensive comparison among five different algorithms in path planning of a novel SRMR system called ACMoD through an environment comprised of various terrains in a static condition. The contribution of this work is that the reconfiguration ability of ACMoD has been taken into account. This consideration, though raises new algorithmic challenges, equips the robot with new capability to pass difficult terrains rather than bypassing them, and consequently the robot can achieve better performance in terms of traversal time and energy consumption. In this work, four different optimization algorithms, including Adaptive Genetic Algorithm, Elitist Ant System, Dijkstra and Dynamic Weighting A*, along with a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-Learning, are proposed to solve this path planning problem.

But in highly cluttered environments, it is hard to find available solutions. We present a novel motion planning strategy which integrates the sampling-based path planning algorithm with the flexible obstacle avoidance approach for finding the efficient path through changing poses of movable obstacles. Following the resulting path, the manipulator can push the obstacles away and move to the target simultaneously. For dealing with the safety issue of the interaction between manipulator and obstacles, a learning-based motion modeling method is proposed for motion prediction of the obstacles being pushed by manipulator, and then the trained models are utilized in the motion planning.

The measurement of the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition of microorganisms around the antimicrobial disks in the antibiogram is frequently performed manually by specialists using a ruler. This is a time-consuming and error-prone task that might be simplified using automated or semi-automated inhibition zone readers. However, most readers are usually expensive instruments with embedded software that require significant changes in laboratory design and workflow. Methods Based on the workflow employed by specialists to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms, we have designed a software tool that, from images of disk diffusion tests, semi-automatises the process. Standard computer vision techniques are employed to achieve such an automatisation. Results We present AntibiogramJ, a user-friendly and open-source software tool to semi-automatically determine, measure and categorise inhibition zones of images from disk diffusion tests. AntibiogramJ is implemented in Java and deals with images captured with any device that incorporates a camera, including digital cameras and mobile phones. The fully automatic procedure of AntibiogramJ for measuring inhibition zones achieves an overall agreement of 87% with an expert microbiologist; moreover, AntibiogramJ includes features to easily detect when the automatic reading is not correct and fix it manually to obtain the correct result. Conclusions AntibiogramJ is a user-friendly, platform-independent, open-source, and free tool that, up to the best of our knowledge, is the most complete software tool for antibiogram analysis without requiring any investment in new equipment or changes in the laboratory.",ar,2017-05-01,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,Antibiograms | Disk diffusion test | ImageJ | Inhibition zone reader | Learning system | OpenCV,2-s2.0-85015400447,S0169260716312895,28391814,Article,Alonso C.,60012329,Universidad de La Rioja,Logrono,Spain,7,"Alonso, C.

We employed similar blocks-based visual programming environments, and we measured emotional engagement, attitudes, and computer programming performance. We found that students were more engaged by and had a higher intention of learning programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms, either robot or wearable, did not affect the students' performance in learning basic computational concepts (e.g., sequence, repeat, and decision).

NO,10.1016/j.artint.2014.11.009,Automated aerial suspended cargo delivery through reinforcement learning,"Cargo-bearing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous potential to assist humans by delivering food, medicine, and other supplies. For time-critical cargo delivery tasks, UAVs need to be able to quickly navigate their environments and deliver suspended payloads with bounded load displacement. As a constraint balancing task for joint UAV-suspended load system dynamics, this task poses a challenge. This article presents a reinforcement learning approach for aerial cargo delivery tasks in environments with static obstacles. We first learn a minimal residual oscillations task policy in obstacle-free environments using a specifically designed feature vector for value function approximation that allows generalization beyond the training domain. The method works in continuous state and discrete action spaces. Since planning for aerial cargo requires very large action space (over 106 actions) that is impractical for learning, we define formal conditions for a class of robotics problems where learning can occur in a simplified problem space and successfully transfer to a broader problem space. Exploiting these guarantees and relying on the discrete action space, we learn the swing-free policy in a subspace several orders of magnitude smaller, and later develop a method for swing-free trajectory planning along a path. As an extension to tasks in environments with static obstacles where the load displacement needs to be bounded throughout the trajectory, sampling-based motion planning generates collision-free paths. Next, a reinforcement learning agent transforms these paths into trajectories that maintain the bound on the load displacement while following the collision-free path in a timely manner. We verify the approach both in simulation and in experiments on a quadrotor with suspended load and verify the method's safety and feasibility through a demonstration where a quadrotor delivers an open container of liquid to a human subject. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, this article presents a solution to a challenging, and vital problem of planning a constraint-balancing task for an inherently unstable non-linear system in the presence of obstacles. Second, AI and robotics researchers can both benefit from the provided theoretical guarantees of system stability on a class of constraint-balancing tasks that occur in very large action spaces.",ar,2017-06-01,Artificial Intelligence,Aerial cargo delivery | Motion planning | Probabilistic roadmaps | Reinforcement learning | Robotics | Rotorcraft | Trajectory planning | UAVs,2-s2.0-84920577661,S0004370214001416,,Article,Faust A.,60159855;60033021,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing;The University of New Mexico",Zagreb;Albuquerque,Croatia;United States,5,"Faust, Aleksandra;Palunko, Ivana;Cruz, Patricio;Fierro, Rafael;Tapia, Lydia",55922020500;24475329300;55325594800;7006028932;14034628800,60033021;60159855;60033021;60033021;60033021,1 June 2017,43702,23675,,Journal,247,,,381-398,1,NSF,1027775,National Science Foundation,72,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370214001416?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.artint.2015.04.004,Efficient interactive decision-making framework for robotic applications,"The inclusion of robots in our society is imminent, such as service robots. Robots are now capable of reliably manipulating objects in our daily lives but only when combined with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for planning and decision-making, which allow a machine to determine how a task can be completed successfully. To perform decision making, AI planning methods use a set of planning operators to code the state changes in the environment produced by a robotic action. Given a specific goal, the planner then searches for the best sequence of planning operators, i.e., the best plan that leads through the state space to satisfy the goal. In principle, planning operators can be hand-coded, but this is impractical for applications that involve many possible state transitions. An alternative is to learn them automatically from experience, which is most efficient when there is a human teacher. In this study, we propose a simple and efficient decision-making framework for this purpose. The robot executes its plan in a step-wise manner and any planning impasse produced by missing operators is resolved online by asking a human teacher for the next action to execute. Based on the observed state transitions, this approach rapidly generates the missing operators by evaluating the relevance of several cause–effect alternatives in parallel using a probability estimate, which compensates for the high uncertainty that is inherent when learning from a small number of samples. We evaluated the validity of our approach in simulated and real environments, where it was benchmarked against previous methods. Humans learn in the same incremental manner, so we consider that our approach may be a better alternative to existing learning paradigms, which require offline learning, a significant amount of previous knowledge, or a large number of samples.",ar,2017-06-01,Artificial Intelligence,Decision making | Human-like task | Logic-based planning | Online learning | Robotics,2-s2.0-84928556182,S0004370215000661,,Article,Agostini A.,60204228;60030064,Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Göttingen;CSIC-UPC - Instituto de Robotica e Informatica Industrial (IRII),Gottingen;Barcelona,Germany;Spain,3,"Agostini, Alejandro;Torras, Carme;Wörgötter, Florentin",24528329400;7003421114;7003438923,60204228;60030064;60204228,1 June 2017,43702,23675,,Journal,247,,,187-212,1,FP7,600578,Seventh Framework Programme,20,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370215000661?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1177/0278364917691112,Structured learning for spoken language understanding in human-robot interaction,"Robots are slowly becoming apart of everyday life, being marketed for commercial applications such as telepresence, cleaning or entertainment. Thus, the ability to interact via natural language with non-expert users is becoming a key requirement. Even if user utterances can be efficiently recognized and transcribed by automatic speech recognition systems, several issues arise in translating them into suitable robotic actions and most of the existing solutions are strictly related to a specific scenario. In this paper, we present an approach to the design of natural language interfaces for human robot interaction, to translate spoken commands into computational structures that enable the robot to execute the intended request. The proposed solution is achieved by combining a general theory of language semantics, i.e. frame semantics, with state-of-the-art methods for robust spoken language understanding, based on structured learning algorithms. The adopted data driven paradigm allows the development of a fully functional natural language processing chain, that can be initialized by re-using available linguistic tools and resources. In addition, it can be also specialized by providing small sets of examples representative of a target newer domain. A systematic benchmarking resource, in terms of a rich and multi-layered spoken corpus has also been created and it has been used to evaluate the natural language processing chain. Our results show that our processing chain, trained with generic resources, provides a solid baseline for command understanding in a service robot domain.

A novel approach to influence diagram learning is presented along with a demonstration method that allows non-experts to teach tasks to the robot in an intuitive manner. The results from three user studies validate that the approach enables both a simulated and a physical robot to learn complex tasks from a variety of teachers, refining those tasks during on-line performance, successfully completing the tasks in different environments, and transferring knowledge from one task to another.",ar,2017-06-01,Autonomous Robots,Bayesian networks | Learning from demonstration | Life long Learning,2-s2.0-84980006497,,,Article,Koenig N.,60029311;113385022,University of Southern California;Open Source Robotics Foundation,Los Angeles;Mountain View,United States;United States,2,"Koenig, Nathan;Matarić, Maja J.",14066111800;7005611984,113385022;60029311,1 June 2017,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,41,5,,1173-1188,0,NSF,IIS-1117279,National Science Foundation,19,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-016-9601-1,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.entcom.2017.04.002,"Entertainment, engagement, and education: Foundations and developments in digital and physical spaces to support learning through making","Making is a relatively new concept applied to describe the increasing attention paid to constructing activities to enable entertaining, and engaging learning. Making focuses on the process that occurs in digital and/or physical spaces that is not always learning oriented, but enables qualities such as problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, and innovation, to name a few. Contemporary technical and infrastructural developments, such as Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, TechShops, and FabLabs, and the appearance of tools such as wearable computing, robotics, 3D printing, microprocessors, and intuitive programming languages, posit making as a very promising research area to support learning processes, especially towards the acquisition of 21st-century learning competences. Collecting learning evidence via rigorous multidimensional and multidisciplinary case studies will allow us to better understand and improve the value of making and the role of the various digital and physical spaces. Drawing from our experience with a recent workshop that used making as a pathway to foster joyful engagement and creativity in learning (Make2Learn), we present the developments, as well as the four selected contributions of this special issue.

High frequency oscillations during underwater motion are responsible for nonlinearities in dynamic behavior of underwater robot as well as uncertainties in hydrodynamic coefficients. Reactive behaviors of underwater robot are designed considering the position and orientation of both target and nearest obstacle from robot’s current position. Human like reasoning power and approximation based learning skill of neural based adaptive fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has been found to be effective for underwater multivariable motion control. More than one ANFIS models are used here for achieving goal and obstacle avoidance while avoiding local minima situation in both horizontal and vertical plane of three dimensional workspace. An error gradient approach based on input-output training patterns for learning purpose has been promoted to spawn trajectory of underwater robot optimizing path length as well as time taken. The simulation and experimental results endorse sturdiness and viability of the proposed method in comparison with other navigational methodologies to negotiate with hectic conditions during motion of underwater mobile robot.,ar,2017-06-01,International Journal of Automation and Computing,Adaptive fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) | error gradient | obstacle avoidance behavior | optimal path | steering angle | target seeking behavior,2-s2.0-85015659483,,,Article,Kundu S.,60000934,National Institute of Technology Rourkela,Rourkela,India,2,"Kundu, Shubhasri;Parhi, Dayal R.",36700050500;6603245659,60000934;60000934,1 June 2017,14768186,5200152703,17518520,Journal,14,3,,307-320,0,,undefined,,13,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11633-016-0983-5,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.jpdc.2016.12.028,SAUCE: A web application for interactive teaching and learning of parallel programming,"Prevalent hardware trends towards parallel architectures and algorithms create a growing demand for graduate students familiar with the programming of concurrent software. However, learning parallel programming is challenging due to complex communication and memory access patterns as well as the avoidance of common pitfalls such as dead-locks and race conditions. Hence, the learning process has to be supported by adequate software solutions in order to enable future computer scientists and engineers to write robust and efficient code. This paper discusses a selection of well-known parallel algorithms based on C++11 threads, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA that can be interactively embedded in an HPC or parallel computing lecture using a unified framework for the automated evaluation of source code—namely the “System for AUtomated Code Evaluation” (SAUCE).

NO,10.1109/TCYB.2016.2633318,"Evolutionary Metric-Learning-Based Recognition Algorithm for Online Isolated Persian/Arabic Characters, Reconstructed Using Inertial Pen Signals","The development of sensors with the microelectromechanical systems technology expedites the emergence of new tools for human-computer interaction, such as inertial pens. These pens, which are used as writing tools, do not depend on a specific embedded hardware, and thus, they are inexpensive. Most of the available inertial pen character recognition approaches use the low-level features of inertial signals. This paper introduces a Persian/Arabic handwriting character recognition system for inertial-sensor-equipped pens. First, the motion trajectory of the inertial pen is reconstructed to estimate the position signals by using the theory of inertial navigation systems. The position signals are then used to extract high-level geometrical features. A new metric learning technique is then adopted to enhance the accuracy of character classification. To this end, a characteristic function is calculated for each character using a genetic programming algorithm. These functions form a metric kernel classifying all the characters. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of one of the state-of-the-art works in terms of recognizing Persian/Arabic handwriting characters.",ar,2017-09-01,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,Character recognition | evolutionary algorithms | geometrical feature | inertial sensor | metric learning,2-s2.0-85006954122,,27992357,Article,Sepahvand M.,60021967,Razi University,Kermanshah,Iran,3,"Sepahvand, Majid;Abdali-Mohammadi, Fardin;Mardukhi, Farhad",57192592627;56282590600;35109701900,60021967;60021967;60021967,September 2017,21682267,21100274221,,Journal,47,9,7782360,2872-2884,0,,undefined,,17,2017,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7782360,,Excluido por nada que ver
NO,10.1007/s10758-017-9328-x,Introducing Computational Thinking to Young Learners: Practicing Computational Perspectives Through Embodiment in Mathematics Education,"A science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-influenced classroom requires learning activities that provide hands-on experiences with technological tools to encourage problem-solving skills (Brophy et al. in J Eng Educ 97(3):369–387, 2008; Matarić et al. in AAAI spring symposium on robots and robot venues: resources for AI education, pp 99–102, 2007). The study aimed to bring computational thinking, an applicable skill set in computer science, into existing mathematics and programming education in elementary classrooms. An essential component of computational thinking is the ability to think like a computer scientist when confronted with a problem (Grover and Pea in Educ Res 42(1):38–43. doi:10.3102/0013189X12463051, 2013). Computational perspectives (Berland and Wilensky in J Sci Educ Technol 24(5):628–647. doi:10.1007/s10956-015-9552-x, 2015) refer to the frame of reference programmers or computer scientists adopt when approaching a problem. The study examined the effects of taking computational perspectives through various degrees of embodied activities (i.e., full vs. low) on students’ achievement in mathematics and programming. The study employed a 2 (full vs. low embodiment) × 2 (with vs. without computational perspective taking) factorial condition to evaluate four learning conditions from a combination of embodiment and computational perspective-taking practice. The results from this experimental study (N = 66 kindergarten and first graders) suggest that full-embody activities combined with the practice of computational perspective-taking in solving mathematics problem improved mathematics understanding and programming skills as demonstrated in Scrath Jr. among novice young learners. Moreover, the practice of using a computational perspective significantly improved students’ understanding of core programming concepts regardless of the level of embodiment.

NO,10.1145/3133886,Synthesis of data completion scripts using finite tree automata,"In application domains that store data in a tabular format, a common task is to fill the values of some cells using values stored in other cells. For instance, such data completion tasks arise in the context of missing value imputation in data science and derived data computation in spreadsheets and relational databases. Unfortunately, end-users and data scientists typically struggle with many data completion tasks that require non-trivial programming expertise. This paper presents a synthesis technique for automating data completion tasks using programming-by-example (PBE) and a very lightweight sketching approach. Given a formula sketch (e.g., AVG(?1, ?2)) and a few input-output examples for each hole, our technique synthesizes a program to automate the desired data completion task. Towards this goal, we propose a domain-specific language (DSL) that combines spatial and relational reasoning over tabular data and a novel synthesis algorithm that can generate DSL programs that are consistent with the input-output examples. The key technical novelty of our approach is a new version space learning algorithm that is based on finite tree automata (FTA). The use of FTAs in the learning algorithm leads to a more compact representation that allows more sharing between programs that are consistent with the examples. We have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called DACE and evaluate it on 84 benchmarks taken from online help forums.

First of all, the H∞ control problem is regarded as a two-player zero-sum game and the adaptive critic mechanism is used to achieve the minimax optimization under event-based environment. Then, based on an improved updating rule, the event-based optimal control law and the time-based worst-case disturbance law are obtained approximately by training a single critic neural network. The initial stabilizing control is no longer required during the implementation process of the new algorithm. Next, the closed-loop system is formulated as an impulsive model and its stability issue is handled by incorporating the improved learning criterion. The infamous Zeno behavior of the present event-based design is also avoided through theoretical analysis on the lower bound of the minimal intersample time.

NO,10.1109/TASE.2017.2731371,Toward Socially Aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic and Crowded Environments: A Proactive Social Motion Model,"Safe and social navigation is the key to deploying a mobile service robot in a human-centered environment. Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort. In this paper, we propose an effective proactive social motion model (PSMM) that enables a mobile service robot to navigate safely and socially in crowded and dynamic environments. The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements. Note to Practitioners - In this paper, we validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive social motion model (PSMM) through both simulation and real-world experiments under the newly proposed human comfortable safety indices. To do that, we first implemented the entire navigation system using the open-source robot operating system. We then installed it in a simulated robot model and conducted experiments in a simulated shopping mall-like environment to verify its effectiveness. We also installed the proposed algorithm on our mobile robot platform and conducted experiments in our office-like laboratory environment. Our results show that the developed socially aware navigation framework allows a mobile robot to navigate safely, socially, and proactively while guaranteeing human safety and comfort in crowded and dynamic environments. In this paper, we examined the proposed PSMM with a set of predefined parameters selected based on our empirical experiences about the robot mechanism and selected social environment. However, in fact a mobile robot might need to adapt to various contextual and cultural situations in different social environments. Thus, it should be equipped with an online adaptive interactive learning mechanism allowing the robot to learn to auto-adjust their parameters according to such embedded environments. Using machine learning techniques, e.g., inverse reinforcement learning [1] to optimize the parameter set for the PSMM could be a promising research direction to improve adaptability of mobile service robots in different social environments. In the future, we will evaluate the proposed framework based on a wider variety of scenarios, particularly those with different social interaction situations and dynamic environments. Furthermore, various kinds of social cues and signals introduced in [2] and [3] will be applied to extend the proposed framework in more complicated social situations and contexts. Last but not least, we will investigate different machine learning techniques and incorporate them in the PSMM in order to allow the robot to automatically adapt to diverse social environments.",ar,2017-10-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Human comfortable safety | mobile service robots | proactive social motion model (PSMM) | social robots | socially aware robot navigation,2-s2.0-85028458074,,,Article,Truong X.,60121871;60072089;60007655,Le Quy Don Technical University;UNIVERSITI BRUNEI DARUSSALAM;University of Prince Edward Island,Hanoi;Bandar Seri Begawan;Charlottetown,Viet Nam;Brunei Darussalam;Canada,2,"Truong, Xuan Tung;Ngo, Trung Dung",56581881400;15755660100,60072089-60121871;60072089-60007655,October 2017,15455955,17340,,Journal,14,4,8011466,1743-1760,0,,undefined,,65,2017,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8011466,,Excluido por no educación

The paper focuses on the development of: (i) a method—Contiguous Non-overlapping Longest Common Subsequence (CNLCS)—based on the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array for detecting loops of actions in a robot experience; and (ii) an abstract planner to instanciate a learned task model with loops for solving particular instances of the same task with varying numbers of objects.

NO,10.1016/j.compag.2017.11.023,Development of a prototype robot and fast path-planning algorithm for static laser weeding,"To demonstrate the feasibility and improve the implementation of laser weeding, a prototype robot was built and equipped with machine vision and gimbal mounted laser pointers. The robot consisted of a mobile platform modified from a small commercial quad bike, a camera to detect the crop and weeds and two steerable gimbals controlling the laser pointers. Visible-one laser pointers were used to simulate the powerful laser trajectories. A colour segmentation algorithm was utilised to extract plants from the soil background; size estimation was used to differentiate crop from weeds; and an erosion and dilation algorithm was developed to separate objects that were touching. Conversely, another algorithm, which utilised shape descriptors, was able to distinguish plant species in non-touching status regardless of area difference. Next, in order to reduce route length and run time, a new path-planning algorithm for static weeding was proposed and tested. It was demonstrated to be more efficient especially when addressing a higher density of weeds. A model was then established to determine the optimal segmentation size, based on the route length for treatment. It was found that the segmentation algorithm has the potential to be widely used in fast path-planning for the travelling-salesman problem. Finally, performance tests in the indoor environments showed that the weeding mean positional error was 1.97 mm, with a 0.88 mm standard deviation. Another test indicated that with a laser traversal speed of 30 mm/s and a dwell time of 0.64 s per weed, it had a hit rate of 97%.",ar,2017-11-01,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,Dual-gimbal | Fast path-planning | Laser weeding robot | Machine vision | Static weeding,2-s2.0-85034596603,S016816991730827X,,Article,Xiong Y.,60018718,Harper Adams University,Shropshire,United Kingdom,4,"Xiong, Ya;Ge, Yuanyue;Liang, Yunlin;Blackmore, Simon",57207216983;57197754273;57197761473;7005963870,60018718;60018718;60018718;60018718,November 2017,1681699,30441,,Journal,142,,,494-503,0,CSC,undefined,Harper Adams University,28,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016816991730827X?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.2316/Journal.206.2017.6.206-5139,A novel designed interactive training platform for industrial robot offline programming and robotics education,"The people interested in industrial robots at a beginner level, such as engineers, operators, or technicians, as well as robotics lecturers typically have difficulties during their first interactions with a robot. The first difficulty is to create a relation between the robot and the mathematical equations of its kinematics. One of the other barriers is to learn the robot workspace and the robot manipulator’s reachability. After achieving these two steps, it possible to start robot programming and physical robot interaction appropriate for industrial robot applications. In this study, a novel interactive training platform is presented. This platform is designed for the offline programming of industrial robots and its goals are to support robot education, practical robot study, and industrial robot science. In this interactive robot platform, all commercial robot brands’ manipulator geometry configuration and new manipulator geometry designs can be created. All functions such as programming, basic movement type (linear, joint, reorient), manipulator workspaces definition, tool centre point and axis velocity, acceleration are available. The platform presents some solid objects that can be inserted in the workspace and can make demonstrations for programming. There are also real programming logic controller and robot connections for offline programming. This platform is designed and developed based on open-source libraries, is small in size, and is able to work on all operating systems (e.g., Windows, Mac, and Linux).

NO,10.3389/frobt.2018.00110,Stage-wise learning of reaching using little prior knowledge,"In some manipulation robotics environments, because of the difficulty of precisely modeling dynamics and computing features which describe well the variety of scene appearances, hand-programming a robot behavior is often intractable. Deep reinforcement learning methods partially alleviate this problem in that they can dispense with hand-crafted features for the state representation and do not need pre-computed dynamics. However, they often use prior information in the task definition in the form of shaping rewards which guide the robot toward goal state areas but require engineering or human supervision and can lead to sub-optimal behavior. In this work we consider a complex robot reaching task with a large range of initial object positions and initial arm positions and propose a new learning approach with minimal supervision. Inspired by developmental robotics, our method consists of a weakly-supervised stage-wise procedure of three tasks. First, the robot learns to fixate the object with a 2-camera system. Second, it learns hand-eye coordination by learning to fixate its end-effector. Third, using the knowledge acquired in the previous steps, it learns to reach the object at different positions and from a large set of initial robot joint angles. Experiments in a simulated environment show that our stage-wise framework yields similar reaching performances, compared with a supervised setting without using kinematic models, hand-crafted features, calibration parameters or supervised visual modules.",ar,2018-01-01,Frontiers Robotics AI,Deep reinforcement learning | Hierarchical learning | Manipulation robotics | Stage-wise learning | Weakly-supervised,2-s2.0-85058320033,,,Article,de La Bourdonnaye F.L.,60083550;60008134,Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies;CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,Frankfurt am Main;Paris,Germany;France,4,"de La Bourdonnaye, François L.;Teulière, Céline;Triesch, Jochen;Chateau, Thierry",57191918180;36461832400;57204294797;6602307093,60008134;60008134;60083550;60008134,2018,,21100868821,22969144,Journal,5,OCT,110,,1,H2020,713010,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,3,2018,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00110/full,,Excluido por no educación

This algorithm finds the shortest path, detects any obstructions in front of the mobile robot using ultrasonic transducers, and adjusts the turning angle of the mobile robot so as to avoid obstacles. To verify the FACO algorithm, simulations using a mobile robot in two environments were carried out. The first environment was shortest-path planning without obstacles. The second environment was shortest-path planning for a single destination with obstacles. This paper also compares tests carried out in a simple Z-shaped environment map and in a complicated environment map. By comparing FACO with a pattern search (PS) algorithm, a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and traditional ACO for the cases in the simple Z-shaped environment map, we found that the path distance obtained using FACO was 2.60, 4.40, 2.04, and 6.53% shorter than that using PS, GA, PSO, and ACO, respectively. In the complex environment map, as compared to the self-adaptive ant colony optimization, FACO had a path distance that was 1.38% shorter.

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873718,Reactive execution of learned tasks with real-time collision avoidance in a dynamic environment,"This paper addresses the problem of learning from demonstration (LfD) and subsequent robot safety control in an unstructured dynamic environment different from the demonstrations. Generally, LfD has been successfully exploited for task programming, but the existing methods have not solved the problem of allowing the entire arm to avoid obstacles while satisfying the task motion constraints (e.g., the robotic arm approaching the target object while avoiding obstacles moving within the environment). To achieve this, we present an incremental LfD approach that combines a task-parameterized probabilistic model and the robot security domain to control a robot's behavior during task execution. Specifically, we propose a safety-oriented and task-oriented control strategy for redundant manipulators that makes full use of the motion redundancy of the manipulator and the space with no task restraints to satisfy the task constraints for human-robot coexistence. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a series of pick-and-pour experiments performed by a manipulator with 7 degree of freedom in a dynamic environment, where the robot must both avoid obstacles and satisfactorily complete the learned task with constraints.",ar,2018-01-01,IEEE Access,Motion and path planning | moving obstacles | probabilistic modelling | robot learning from demonstration,2-s2.0-85054512596,,,Article,Liu G.,60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,4,"Liu, Gangfeng;Song, Caiwei;Zang, Xizhe;Zhao, Jie",25655173100;57191592489;13611954300;57203289935,60019616;60019616;60019616;60019616,2018,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,6,,8481490,57366-57375,1,NSFC,2017YFB1302301,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8481490,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

However, this is a difficult task and can be helped if the robot is able to learn how to use a tool by itself. Most of the work in tool use learning by a robot is done using a feature-based representation. Despite many successful results, this representation is limited in the types of tools and tasks that can be handled. Furthermore, the complex relationship between a tool and other world objects cannot be captured easily. Relational learning methods have been proposed to overcome these weaknesses [1, 2]. However, they have only been evaluated in a sensor-less simulation to avoid the complexities and uncertainties of the real world. We present a real world implementation of a relational tool use learning system for a robot.

NO,10.3389/fnbot.2018.00005,Learning by demonstration for motion planning of upper-limb exoskeletons,"The reference joint position of upper-limb exoskeletons is typically obtained by means of Cartesian motion planners and inverse kinematics algorithms with the inverse Jacobian; this approach allows exploiting the available Degrees of Freedom (i.e. DoFs) of the robot kinematic chain to achieve the desired end-effector pose; however, if used to operate non-redundant exoskeletons, it does not ensure that anthropomorphic criteria are satisfied in the whole human-robot workspace. This paper proposes a motion planning system, based on Learning by Demonstration, for upper-limb exoskeletons that allow successfully assisting patients during Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in unstructured environment, while ensuring that anthropomorphic criteria are satisfied in the whole human-robot workspace. The motion planning system combines Learning by Demonstration with the computation of Dynamic Motion Primitives and machine learning techniques to construct task- and patient-specific joint trajectories based on the learnt trajectories. System validation was carried out in simulation and in a real setting with a 4-DoF upper-limb exoskeleton, a 5-DoF wrist-hand exoskeleton and four patients with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. Validation was addressed to (i) compare the performance of the proposed motion planning with traditional methods; (ii) assess the generalization capabilities of the proposed method with respect to the environment variability. Three ADLs were chosen to validate the system: drinking, pouring and lifting a light sphere. The achieved results showed a 100% success rate in the task fulfillment, with a high level of generalization with respect to the environment variability. Moreover, an anthropomorphic configuration of the exoskeleton is always ensured.",ar,2018-01-01,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,Assistive robotics | Dynamics movement primitives | Learning by demonstration | Machine learning | Motion planning,2-s2.0-85042454067,,,Article,Lauretti C.,60083100;60029767;60028039;60016476;60005308;120272656,Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi;Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche;Sant'Anna Scuola Universitaria Superiore Pisa;Universidad de Cádiz;Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma;GLIC,Milan;Elche;Pisa;Cadiz;Rome;Bologna,Italy;Spain;Italy;Spain;Italy;Italy,12,"Lauretti, Clemente;Cordella, Francesca;Ciancio, Anna Lisa;Trigili, Emilio;Catalan, Jose Maria;Badesa, Francisco Javier;Crea, Simona;Pagliara, Silvio Marcello;Sterzi, Silvia;Vitiello, Nicola;Aracil, Nicolas Garcia;Zollo, Loredana",57190843525;55388280900;53879404600;57190834496;56992476300;26428670800;55388629200;14523356200;55874666000;14055167900;15762531900;55902740000,60005308;60005308;60005308;60028039;60029767;60016476;60028039;120272656;60005308;60028039-60083100;60029767;60005308,2018,,21100199837,16625218,Journal,12,FEB,5,,1,H2020,C82F17000040001,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,26,2018,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2018.00005/full,,Excluido por no educación

The user selects a set of abilities for the desired robot, and the system automatically generates the robot structure and the controllers needed for the high level programming of the robot. This process relies on two pivotal concepts for our approach: Ontologies and modular robots. An ontology (ADROn), constructed upon the IEEE Standard Ontologies for Robotics and Automation (ORA), is used by an intelligent system to relate the robot types with the requested set of abilities. Then, a parameterized design process generates the passive components (e.g. links) and selects the active modules (e.g. actuators) from a collection of 3D printable, modular robotic components (ParMoR). Finally, the controllers, generated as ROS services, are interfaced with a visual programming language, Bitbloq, suitable for novice users. Examples of the generation process of different types of robots (wheeled, snake, humanoid, hexapods) are detailed.

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2882875,RL and ANN based modular path planning controller for resource-constrained robots in the indoor complex dynamic environment,"Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are designed to work well in static environments. In many real-world scenarios, the environments are complex and dynamic, in which the performance of traditional RL approaches may drastically degrade. One of the factors which results in the dynamicity and complexity of the environment is a change in the position and number of obstacles. This paper presents a path planning approach for autonomous mobile robots in a complex dynamic indoor environment, where the dynamic pattern of obstacles will not drastically affect the performance of RL models. Two independent modules, collision avoidance without considering the goal position and goal-seeking without considering obstacles avoidance, are trained independently using artificial neural networks and RL to obtain their best control policies. Then, a switching function is used to combine the two trained modules for realizing the obstacle avoidance and global path planning in a complex dynamic indoor environment. Furthermore, this control system is designed with a special focus on the computational and memory requirements of resource-constrained robots. The design was tested in a real-world environment on a mini-robot with constrained resources. Along with the static and dynamic obstacles' avoidance, this system has the ability to achieve both static and dynamic targets. This control system can also be used to train a robot in the real world using RL when the robot cannot afford to collide.

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872751,UGV Navigation Optimization Aided by Reinforcement Learning-Based Path Tracking,"The success of robotic, such as UGV systems, largely benefits from the fundamental capability of autonomously finding collision-free path(s) to commit mobile tasks in routinely rough and complicated environments. Optimization of navigation under such circumstance has long been an open problem: 1) to meet the critical requirements of this task typically including the shortest distance and smoothness and 2) more challengingly, to enable a general solution to track the optimal path in real-time outdoor applications. Aiming at the problem, this study develops a two-tier approach to navigation optimization in terms of path planning and tracking. First, a 'rope' model has been designed to mimic the deformation of a path in axial direction under external force and the fixedness of the radial plane to contain a UGV in a collision-free space. Second, a deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm has been trained efficiently on abstracted structures of an arbitrarily derived 'rope' to model the controller for tracking the optimal path. The learned policy can be generalized to a variety of scenarios. Experiments have been performed over complicated environments of different types. The results indicate that: 1) the rope model helps in minimizing distance and enhancing smoothness of the path, while guarantees the clearance; 2) the DPG can be modeled quickly (in a couple of minutes on an office desktop) and the model can apply to environments of increasing complexity under the circumstance of external disturbances without the need for tuning parameters; and 3) the DPG-based controller can autonomously adjust the UGV to follow the correct path free of risks by itself.",ar,2018-01-01,IEEE Access,deterministic policy gradient | path tracking | reinforcement learning | UGV navigation,2-s2.0-85054408859,,,Article,Wei M.,60029306,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,4,"Wei, Minggao;Wang, Song;Zheng, Jinfan;Chen, Dan",57193726705;55880120900;57204062973;7405449711,60029306;60029306;60029306;60029306,2018,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,6,,8476521,57814-57825,1,NSFC,61772380,National Natural Science Foundation of China,9,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8476521,,Excluido por no educación

Students in the maker group received weekly educational robotics lessons, whereas those in the nonmaker group only engaged in other after-school learning activities such as homework practice in traditional classrooms. Mixed methods research was used for data collection. An experiment with a pretest–posttest and control group design was employed to measure the students’ electrical engineering and computer programming content knowledge and problem-solving skills.

In this robot team, the roles are explicitly divided. The carrier oversees the transportation, deployment, and retrieval of the rovers, whereas the rovers are responsible for performing tasks such as reconnaissance and search and rescue. We aim to use this robot team to minimize the maximum amount of time that each rover requires to reach a given task location. However, only a few studies have addressed pathplanning for robot teams. To generate an efficient path, the mobility and energy limitations of the robots and the obstacles in the environment must be considered.

NO,10.26583/sv.10.5.05,The image analysis of the geometric bodies with supplemental interactive block for training new knowledge in a limited natural language,"The prototype of the system for image analysis of geometric bodies, using the interface of logical and visual programming, was developed by the author for experiments with an intelligent robot that is equipped with a video camera. It is assumed that the robot is designed to plan its actions - capture and transfer of bodies. The class of bodies considered by the author is colored polyhedra in local colors. The drawback of the results obtained in the author's previous publication is the absence of an analysis of the relative location of the identified set of polyhedra. Obvious are the difficulties that can arise when trying to automatically (without the participation of a person) to identify the mutual arrangement of bodies. The task is facilitated by the inclusion in the system of the block of interactive training of the robot by man. This person is an operator - a person who can formulate his description of a specific image in a limited natural language. The form of this description is the so-called surface structures of natural language phrases. In this article, the author presents the program of syntactic analysis of surface structures necessary for this purpose. This program is implemented on Prolog - the language of logical programming. To illustrate the results of the training block implemented on Prolog, the author, like in his previous publication, offers a visual programming interface (Visual Basic language) and logical programming (Prolog language). The article presents an example of a concrete image, on which 5 bodies of different colors are revealed. This example allowed us to demonstrate the most typical cases of the relative positioning of bodies, their description on the surface structures proposed by the author and the syntactic analysis of the phrases of this language. An important side effect of syntactic analysis is also presented - the construction of deep structures of a limited natural language. These structures are represented in the form of structures of the language Prolog - on the developed by the author language of deep structures.

NO,10.1109/TOH.2017.2753233,Functional Contour-following via Haptic Perception and Reinforcement Learning,"Many tasks involve the fine manipulation of objects despite limited visual feedback. In such scenarios, tactile and proprioceptive feedback can be leveraged for task completion. We present an approach for real-time haptic perception and decision-making for a haptics-driven, functional contour-following task: The closure of a ziplock bag. This task is challenging for robots because the bag is deformable, transparent, and visually occluded by artificial fingertip sensors that are also compliant. A deep neural net classifier was trained to estimate the state of a zipper within a robot's pinch grasp. A Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (C-MAB) reinforcement learning algorithm was implemented to maximize cumulative rewards by balancing exploration versus exploitation of the state-action space. The C-MAB learner outperformed a benchmark Q-learner by more efficiently exploring the state-action space while learning a hard-to-code task. The learned C-MAB policy was tested with novel ziplock bag scenarios and contours (wire, rope). Importantly, this work contributes to the development of reinforcement learning approaches that account for limited resources such as hardware life and researcher time.

The authors share their practical experiences of creating autonomous vehicle systems. These systems are complex, consisting of three major subsystems: (1) algorithms for localization, perception, and planning and control; (2) client systems, such as the robotics operating system and hardware platform; and (3) the cloud platform, which includes data storage, simulation, high-definition (HD) mapping, and deep learning model training. The algorithm subsystem extracts meaningful information from sensor raw data to understand its environment and make decisions about its actions.

In this paper, a fractional order PID controller is designed for the position control of a two wheeled inverted pendulum. The pendulum is modeled with DC electrical motors to obtain a more realistic model. Integer order PID controller is also designed to make a comparison with fractional order controller and all controllers are optimized by swarm algorithms to be sure obtained the best performance for each controller. A fractional order PID controller has two extra parameters (λ and μ) and totally five parameters to be optimized. Optimization algorithms are powerful tools for designing a controller, and guarantee finding an optimum result. However, each optimization algorithm has a different performance not only because of the structure of the algorithm but also depending on the optimization problem. Because of this, four popular optimization algorithms (artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimization, grey wolf optimizer, and cuckoo search algorithm) are used to tune controller parameters, and compared regard with the optimized system performance. The results show that the best performance is obtained by the fractional order PID controller, which optimized by artificial bee colony algorithm. The fractional order PID controllers have also better performance than integer order PIDs when used the same optimization algorithm for tuning.",ar,2018-01-01,IEEE Access,Artificial bee colony | cuckoo search algorithm | fractional order controller | grey Wolf optimizer | optimal control | particle swarm optimization | position control,2-s2.0-85057779043,,,Article,Erkol H.,60085899,Karabük Üniversitesi,Karabuk,Turkey,1,"Erkol, Huseyin Oktay",56450807300,60085899,2018,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,6,,8548547,75709-75717,1,,undefined,,16,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8548547,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

Building on our previous work [J. D. Langsfeld, A. M. Kabir, K. N. Kaipa, and S. K. Gupta, 'Robotic bimanual cleaning of deformable objects with online learning of part and tool models,' in Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Autom. Sci. Eng., 2016, pp. 626-632.], significant extensions are made in this letter by presenting new methods that lead to an overall improvement in the results. The robot system plans the actions of both the grasping and cleaning arms using its current model of the part deformation behavior, and attempts to minimize the overall cleaning time by finding plans that use a small number of grasping positions on the part. A finite-element method approach is used to model the part deformation and a general update algorithm is presented that can modify the stiffness parameters of the model to match observed deformation data collected during cleaning. This allows the system to very quickly discover the correct locations to grasp the part so as to minimize deformation. The methods described in this lettter are shown to achieve better results than the ones from our previous work: The results are much smoother, along with a twofold reduction in parameter-estimation error, and notable faster convergence.",ar,2018-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Dual arm manipulation | industrial robots | manipulation planning,2-s2.0-85054477378,,,Article,Langsfeld J.D.,60078684;60029311;60007652,A.

NO,10.1541/ieejeiss.138.1108,Operation verification of deep learning applications on small computers,"Recently, deep learning technologies have been in the spotlight. Deep learning is one of a powerful technology to classify or recognize objects which captured by a camera. Such application has a high affinity with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, it is considered that these technologies are used in embedded systems and IoT devices. In this paper, we verify deep learning applications like image classification can work well on a small computer such as Raspberry Pi. We develop three deep learning applications by using two types of deep learning frameworks (libraries). We prepare four types of small computers, and these applications are tested on the computers. In addition, we also investigate the relationship between the processing time, the memory consumption and the number of parameters of the deep neural network model. The verification experiments show that a program based on a deep learning library implemented by C++ language fast run and simple neural network models could work in real-time on small computers. Besides, the other experiment also clears that the more parameters increase the processing time and the consumption memory in proportion without depending on the deep learning libraries and small computers.",ar,2018-01-01,"IEEJ Transactions on Electronics, Information and Systems",Consumption memory | Deep learning | Execution time | Small computer | The number of parameters,2-s2.0-85052650142,,,Article,Nishizaki H.,60009064,University of Yamanashi,Kofu,Japan,3,"Nishizaki, Hiromitsu;Leow, Chee Siang;Makino, Koji",7004310832;57203678705;36634702200,60009064;60009064;60009064,2018,3854221,3300147412,13488155,Journal,138,9,,1108-1115,0,JSPS,16K12486,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,0,2018,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejeiss/138/9/138_1108/_article/-char/ja/,,Excluido por machine learning

Many new additive manufacturing platforms are being developed using a robotic based system for the positioning. It is proposed to use a collaborative robot solution to teach a ‘median line’ based travel path for a bead deposition based system to help with junction decision making. This input complements the model geometry and process planning settings. The logic for these tool paths is challenging algorithmically, but a process designer may have a solution in mind that it would be easier to teach; hence, integrating collaborative robots as part of the solution. Traditional robot systems require you to know the solution approach, while manual teaching involves intuition, and personal application experience. The collaborative robot is used with a designer as an intermediate step for rapid travel path development, as collaborative robots are designed for safe human-machine interactions. The designer generates path data via a collaborative robot, which is imported into process planning software. This ‘proof of concept’ work will be extended. The travel ‘knowledge-based’ data will be combined with the actual part geometry to develop a travel path using the input logic as a foundation.",ar,2018-01-10,Computer-Aided Design and Applications,Additive manufacturing | Collaborative robots | Process planning,2-s2.0-85040995337,,,Article,Djuric A.,60012468;60009408,University of Windsor;Wayne State University,Windsor;Detroit,Canada;United States,2,"Djuric, Ana;Urbanic, R.

To guarantee camera imaging system for high-quality images and achieve automatic illumination control in the motion of inspection robot under dark environment, this paper proposes an optimal light intensity planning method based image quality analysis. It is mainly achieved by building a computational model to automatically predict optimal light intensity values for desired image quality when camera observation distances fluctuate. Before regression modeling, it is necessary to extract discriminative features representing image quality. We design feature extractor by deep learning instead of human engineers which required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise.

Approaches that introduce new concepts, like predicate invention in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques, normally require the selection of examples by the user. Techniques that learn behavior policies through exploration like Reinforcement Learning (RL) with intrinsic motivation, to guide the agent into interesting areas to discover new goals, assume that all the states and actions are predefined in advance. In this paper, we describe a system, called ADC, that combines techniques from ILP with predicate invention and RL with intrinsic motivation to discover new concepts, states and actions to learn behavior policies. ADC drives its own learning process, collecting its own examples for autonomously learning concepts.

Since LMDP is regarded as model-based reinforcement learning, the performance of LMDP is sensitive to the accuracy of the environmental model. To overcome the problem of the sensitivity, linearly solvable Markov game (LMG) has been proposed, which is an extension of LMDP based on the game theory. This paper investigates the robustness of LMDP- and LMG-based controllers against modeling errors in both discrete and continuous state-action problems. When there is a discrepancy between the model used for building the control policy and dynamics of the tested environment, the LMG-based control policy maintained good performance while that of the LMDP-based control policy deteriorated drastically.

SI,10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.029,"Phogo: A low cost, free and “maker” revisit to Logo","Today it is almost impossible to spend a single day without depending on an information system, a computer or any other form of computation. Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities.

This model encodes covariation laws between sensors and motors in a modular fashion and exploits these primitive skills to build complex action sequences, potentially involving tool-use. Implemented for a robotic arm, the model starts with raw unlabeled sensor and motor vectors and autonomously assigns functions to neutral objects in the environment.

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2017.12.001,Robot learning from demonstrations: Emulation learning in environments with moving obstacles,"In this paper, we present an approach to the problem of Robot Learning from Demonstration (RLfD) in a dynamic environment, i.e. an environment whose state changes throughout the course of performing a task. RLfD mostly has been successfully exploited only in non-varying environments to reduce the programming time and cost, e.g. fixed manufacturing workspaces. Non-conventional production lines necessitate Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC) implying robots and humans must work in shared workspaces. In such conditions, the robot needs to avoid colliding with the objects that are moved by humans in the workspace. Therefore, not only is the robot: (i) required to learn a task model from demonstrations; but also, (ii) must learn a control policy to avoid a stationary obstacle. Furthermore, (iii) it needs to build a control policy from demonstration to avoid moving obstacles. Here, we present an incremental approach to RLfD addressing all these three problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RLfD approach, by a series of pick-and-place experiments by an ABB YuMi robot. The experimental results show that a person can work in a workspace shared with a robot where the robot successfully avoids colliding with him.",ar,2018-03-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Dynamic environment | Moving obstacles | Robot learning from demonstration,2-s2.0-85042624828,S0921889017302981,,Article,Ghalamzan E.

In this paper, a decentralized control approach is presented for torque sensorless MRRs in contact with uncertain environment via an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)-based neuro-optimal compensation strategy. The dynamic model of the MRRs is formulated based on a novel joint torque estimation method, which is deployed for each joint model, and the joint dynamic information is utilized effectively to design the feedback controllers, thus making the decentralized optimal control problem of the environmental contacted MRR systems be formulated as an optimal compensation issue of model uncertainty. By using the ADP method, a local online policy iteration algorithm is employed to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation with a modified cost function, which is approximated by constructing a critic neural network, and then the approximate optimal control policy can be derived. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop MRR system is proved by using the Lyapunov theory. At last, simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",ar,2018-03-22,Neurocomputing,Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) | Decentralized control | Modular and reconfigurable robot | Neural networks | Optimal control,2-s2.0-85038814062,S0925231217318398,,Article,Dong B.,60018486;60011500,Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences;Changchun University of Technology,Beijing;Changchun,China;China,4,"Dong, Bo;Zhou, Fan;Liu, Keping;Li, Yuanchun",57203180228;56946065900;7404199525;55932117000,60011500-60018486;60011500;60011500;60011500,22 March 2018,9252312,24807,18728286,Journal,282,,,60-73,0,NSFC,JJKH20170569KJ,National Natural Science Foundation of China,16,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231217318398?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1109/TRO.2018.2793890,Cooperative Collision Avoidance for Nonholonomic Robots,"In this paper, we present a method, namely CCA, for collision avoidance in dynamic environments among interacting agents, such as other robots or humans. Given a preferred motion by a global planner or driver, the method computes a collision-free local motion for a short time horizon, which respects the actuator constraints and allows for smooth and safe control. The method builds on the concept of reciprocal velocity obstacles and extends it to respect the kinodynamic constraints of the robot and account for a grid-based map representation of the environment. The method is best suited for large multirobot settings, including heterogeneous teams of robots, in which computational complexity is of paramount importance and the robots interact with one another. In particular, we consider a set of motion primitives for the robot and solve an optimization in the space of control velocities with additional constraints. Additionally, we propose a cooperative approach to compute safe velocity partitions in the distributed case. We describe several instances of the method for distributed and centralized operation and formulated both as convex and nonconvex optimizations. We compare the different variants and describe the benefits and tradeoffs both theoretically and in extensive experiments with various robotic platforms: robotic wheelchairs, robotic boats, humanoid robots, small unicycle robots, and simulated cars.",ar,2018-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Autonomous robots | collision avoidance | motion planning | multi-robot systems | robot control | robot motion,2-s2.0-85044360445,,,Article,Alonso-Mora J.,60118240;60032776;60025858,"Department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft;The Walt Disney Company;ETH Zürich","Delft;Burbank;Zurich ZH,",Netherlands;United States;Switzerland,3,"Alonso-Mora, Javier;Beardsley, Paul;Siegwart, Roland",37057150200;7005022858;35926876800,60118240;60032776;60025858,April 2018,15523098,95101,,Journal,34,2,,404-420,0,,undefined,,57,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8322444,,Excluido por no educación

This is due to the vast progress of these robots in terms of precision and stiffness. Moreover, there is a recent development of off-line programming. Consequently, industrial robots offer a real gain of modularity, flexibility, and access for machining on production lines, and are viable solutions to improve the productivity. At the same time, all the potentials of CAD/CAM solutions available for machining off-line programming are not fully exploited because of old G-code (ISO 6963, 1980) language that only enables the description of elementary actions and tools moves. In the context of Industry 4.0 and the development of smart equipments at all levels of production chain, the manufacturing digital thread has to be profoundly reconsidered in order to guarantee high-level information from the design to the manufacturing. In this paper, a solution is proposed based on the high-level programming STEP-NC standard combined with a suitable CAD/CAM solution for industrial robots machining.

A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish. While programming their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others. Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students. When an error is found, the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level. We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies. An online nation-wide competition where more than 10,000 students participated. And, a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools. We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported interest, etc.) and found that girls' engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys' for most indicators. Also, in the online competition, the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice.

SI,10.1515/itit-2017-0032,Empowering learners with tools in CS education: Physical computing in secondary schools,"In computer science, computer systems are both, objects of investigation and tools that enable creative learning and design. Tools for learning have a long tradition in computer science education. Already in the late 1960s, Papert developed a concept which had an immense impact on the development of informal education in the following years: his theory of constructionism understands learning as a creative process of knowledge construction that is most effective when learners create something purposeful that they can try out, show around, discuss, analyse and receive praise for. By now, there are numerous learning and programming environments that are based on the constructionist ideas. Modern tools offer opportunities for students to learn in motivating ways and gain impressive results in programming games, animations, implementing 3D models or developing interactive objects. This article gives an overview of computer science education research related to tools and media to be used in educational settings. We analyse different types of tools with a special focus on the categorization and development of tools for student adequate physical computing activities in the classroom. Research around the development and evaluation of tools and learning resources in the domain of physical computing is illustrated with the example of ""My Interactive Garden"", a constructionist learning and programming environment.

NO,10.1177/0278364918771476,Towards real-time 3D continuous occupancy mapping using Hilbert maps,"The ability to model the surrounding space and determine which areas are occupied is of key importance in many robotic applications, ranging from grasping and manipulation to path planning and obstacle avoidance. Occupancy modeling is often hindered by several factors, such as: real-time constraints, that require quick updates and access to estimates; quality of available data, that may contain gaps and partial occlusions; and memory requirements, especially for large-scale environments. In this work we propose a novel framework that elegantly addresses all these issues, by producing an efficient non-stationary continuous occupancy function that can be efficiently queried at arbitrary resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce techniques that allow the learning of individual features for different areas of the input space, that are better able to model its contained information and promote a higher-level understanding of the observed scene. Experimental tests were conducted on both simulated and real large-scale datasets, showing how the proposed framework rivals current state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational speed while achieving a substantial decrease (of orders of magnitude) in memory requirements and demonstrating better interpolative powers, that are able to smooth out sparse and noisy information.",ar,2018-05-01,International Journal of Robotics Research,3D modeling | kernel methods | Occupancy mapping | reproducing kernel Hilbert space | scene reconstruction,2-s2.0-85047391698,,,Article,Guizilini V.,60025709,The University of Sydney,Sydney,Australia,2,"Guizilini, Vitor;Ramos, Fabio",34880043500;15763518200,60025709;60025709,1 May 2018,2783649,18050,17413176,Journal,37,6,,566-584,0,Usyd,undefined,University of Sydney,6,2018,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364918771476,,Excluido por nada que ver

Then, a novel self-adaptive learning mechanism is developed to adaptively select the most suitable search strategies at different stages of the optimization process, which can improve the search ability of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Moreover, in order to enhance the feasibility of the generated paths, we further apply the new bound violation handling schemes to restrict the velocity and position of each particle.

Furthermore, the feature fusion layer takes both advantages of deep belief networks and improved CRFs, which is able to achieve deep structured learning according to the comprehensive semantic information of objects and semantic correlation information among objects. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SSIDFNs achieve the best mean accuracy 53.8% and 54.6% on the standard RGB-D datasets NYUDv2 and SUNRGBD respectively, which will be helpful to implement intelligent computer vision tasks, such as robot task planning and self-driving cars.",ar,2018-05-01,Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao/Acta Electronica Sinica,Computer vision | Conditional random fields | Convolutional neural networks | Deep belief networks | Deep learning | RGB-D scene parsing | Robot task planning | Self-driving cars | Spatial structured inference model,2-s2.0-85053922301,,,Article,Wang Z.,60003977;60003353,Northwestern Polytechnical University;Harbin Engineering University,Xi'an;Harbin,China;China,4,"Wang, Ze Yu;Wu, Yan Xia;Zhang, Guo Yin;Bu, Shu Hui",57201341721;43362038300;8271473300;24479271800,60003353;60003353;60003353;60003977,1 May 2018,3722112,24288,,Journal,46,5,,1253-1258,0,,undefined,,4,2018,https://doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.0372-2112.2018.05.035,,Excluido por nada que ver

Their newest initiative, the Playmaker Programme, has focused on teaching robotics and coding in preschool settings. Robotics offers a playful and collaborative way for children to engage with foundational technology and engineering concepts during their formative early childhood years. This study looks at a sample of preschool children (N = 98) from five early childhood centers in Singapore who completed a 7-week STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) KIBO robotics curriculum in their classrooms called, “Dances from Around the World.” KIBO is a newly developed robotics kit that teaches both engineering and programming. KIBO’s actions are programmed using tangible programming blocks—no screen-time required. Children’s knowledge of programming concepts were assessed upon completion of the curriculum using the Solve-Its assessment. Results indicate that children were highly successful at mastering foundational programming concepts. Additionally, teachers were successful at promoting a collaborative and creative environment, but less successful at finding ways to engage with the greater school community through robotics. This research study was part of a large country-wide initiative to increase the use of developmentally appropriate engineering tools in early childhood settings.

The proposed approach uses an online least-squared policy iteration scheme for value function approximation in order to estimate optimal policy, in conjunction with a low-level control system that controls the magnitude of the linear velocity, and the orientation of the platform. Primary goal of the proposed scheme is the reduction of the consumed energy. To that end, we propose a variable reward function that depends on the energy consumption of the platform. We evaluate our approach in a complex and realistic simulation environment and report results concerning its performance on estimating optimal navigation policies under different environmental disturbances, and position GPS measurement noise. The proposed framework is compared, in terms of energy consumption, to a baseline approach based on virtual potential fields.

The algorithm is inspired by recent experimental evidence for experience-dependent plasticity of axonal conductance. Based on this evidence, we developed a novel learning rule that altered axonal delays corresponding to cost traversals and demonstrated its effectiveness on real-world environmental maps. We implemented the spiking neuron path planning algorithm on an autonomous robot that can adjust its routes depending on the context of the environment. The robot demonstrates the ability to plan different trajectories that exploit smooth roads when energy conservation is advantageous, or plan the shortest path across a grass field when reducing distance traveled is beneficial.

The interdisciplinary project associated with this analysis aims to engage diverse students in authentic STEM practices by creating robotic technologies that can assist people in their school, and connect with remote peers. The goal of this project is to increase student interest in and knowledge of STEM topics, and to help students recognize STEM as relevant to their daily lives and broader societal issues. The human-centered focus of the curriculum encouraged thinking from multiple perspectives (e.g. design, social science, programming) and allowed for diverse STEM exploration. We present samples from student work and classroom interactions. These samples show challenges and successes in engaging students with STEM as a combination of social and technical questions and skills. We trace the trajectory of one group’s work to highlight moments in which students navigated an engineering design cycle, analyzed and designed social environments, and crossed disciplinary domains through HCR design—using a phenomena, mechanisms, components framework (PMC) to explore systems thinking. Phenomena refers to attention to the function of the robotic technology in the classroom environment. Components included a focus on single parts of the robot, while mechanism addressed how parts of the robot worked together.

An heterogeneous parallel convolutional implementation based on OpenCL is also presented to further improve the time performance of the scheme. Comparison tests with three classic deep learning neural networks MNIST, Cifar-10 and CaffeNet show that in the absence of any model precision loss, the time consuming after parallelization is far less than that before parallel, and time performance increases up to 2 times.

NO,10.1016/j.eswa.2017.11.011,Towards a common implementation of reinforcement learning for multiple robotic tasks,"Mobile robots are increasingly being employed for performing complex tasks in dynamic environments. Those tasks can be either explicitly programmed by an engineer or learned by means of some automatic learning method, which improves the adaptability of the robot and reduces the effort of setting it up. In this sense, reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized as a promising tool for a machine to learn autonomously how to do tasks that are specified in a relatively simple manner. However, the dependency between these methods and the particular task to learn is a well-known problem that has strongly restricted practical implementations in robotics so far. Breaking this barrier would have a significant impact on these and other intelligent systems; in particular, having a core method that requires little tuning effort for being applicable to diverse tasks would boost their autonomy in learning and self-adaptation capabilities. In this paper we present such a practical core implementation of RL, which enables the learning process for multiple robotic tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods, we introduce a novel approach for action selection, called Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), that takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, robot pose, etc.), thus experienced sets of states accelerate the decision-making process of unexplored or rarely-explored states. Intensive experiments with both real and simulated robots, carried out with the software framework also introduced here, show that our implementation is able to learn different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. They also suggest that the combination of true online SARSA(λ) (TOSL) with QBIASSR can outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks. All of these are promising results towards the possibility of learning much more complex tasks autonomously by a robotic agent.",ar,2018-06-15,Expert Systems with Applications,Exploration | Reinforcement learning | Robotics,2-s2.0-85035079318,S0957417417307613,,Article,Martínez-Tenor A.,113986185,Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga,Malaga,Spain,4,"Martínez-Tenor, Angel;Fernández-Madrigal, Juan Antonio;Cruz-Martín, Ana;González-Jiménez, Javier",56685789900;6507644323;23008198300;6603553203,113986185;113986185;113986185;113986185,15 June 2018,9574174,24201,,Journal,100,,,246-259,0,,DPI2014-55826-R,,18,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417417307613?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por machine learning

Based on the assembly experience obtained from the demonstration learning by presenters, a multiple deep deterministic policy gradient (M-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to modify the assembly parameters in order to improve the adaptability to the changes of assembly objects and environment. On the basis of demonstration programming, reinforcement learning is carried out to ensure that the robot performs its tasks stably. In demonstration programming experiment, an improved PCNN (parallel convolution neural network) is proposed, named 1-D PCNN (1D-PCNN), which automatically extracts feature inertia and EMG through 1-dimensional convolution and pooling and enhances the generalization performance and accuracy of gesture recognition. In the demonstration reproduction experiment, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to statistically encode the demo data, and Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) is used to reproduce the robot's trajectory and eliminate noise points. Finally, the environmental changes in the X-axis and Y-axis directions are acquired respectively with Primesense Carmine camera by using the fusion tracking algorithm based on the frame difference method and the multiple kernel correlation filter (MKCF) algorithm. Two identical network structures are used to concurrently carry out the deep reinforcement learning of continuous processes.

To model such spatiotemporal variation, we extend the standard Markov decision process (MDP) to a new framework called the time-varying Markov decision process (TVMDP). The TVMDP has a time-varying state transition model and transforms the standard MDP that considers only immediate and static uncertainty descriptions of state transitions, to a framework that is able to adapt to future time-varying transition dynamics over some horizon.

In the complex environment where the physiotherapist, the body weight support treadmill training robot and the patient coexist, the physiotherapist wears on the master exoskeleton mechanism and walks directly to plan the space-time gait parameters. It integrates rehabilitation experience of the physiotherapist and the assessment of patients. Firstly, the kinematics model is established based on the screw theory, and the motion mapping is realized from the physiotherapist space to the robot space. Then, the joint moving trajectories of the robot, the gravity adjustment trajectory of the weight support mechanism and the walking velocity of the treadmill are planned as a whole. Finally, the effectiveness of the space-time gait planning method is verified by real-time acquisition of the physiotherapist gait parameters, motion mapping test and robot trajectory tracking tests. Results show that the planning angles of the hip and knee joints are in the range of human joint motion, and the angular velocities of the joints are smooth. The joint trajectory planning and gravity adjustment planning conform to the physiological characteristics of human walking.

The development of an assistive robotic bath system, which constitutes a central motivation of this letter, would increase the independence and safety of this procedure, ameliorating in this way the everyday life for this group of people. In general terms, the main goal of this letter is to enable natural, physical human-robot interaction, involving human-friendly and user-adaptive online robot motion planning and interaction control. For this purpose, we employ imitation learning using a leader-follower framework called coordinate change dynamic movement primitives (CC-DMP), in order to incorporate the expertise of professional carers for bathing sequences. In this letter, we propose a vision-based washing system, combining CC-DMP framework with a perception-based controller, to adapt the motion of robot's end effector on moving and deformable surfaces, such as a human body part.

This paper proposed a Markov reinforcement learning model and an improved genetic algorithm optimization model to solve such problems. Compared with several common global optimization algorithms, the proposed Markov decision process (MDP) surrogated greedy policy is more effective and accurate in dealing such sequential small-scale decision-making problems under uncertainties. The proposed MDP model is used to generate drilling trajectory in Cartesian space, where quintic splines were applied on motion planning of the tool centre point. Inverse kinematics in the joint space is applied to generate a high smooth trajectory. The damped reciprocals method is used to avoid the singularities generated in motion. The minimum-time motion planning has been discussed based on the combination of elitist genetic algorithm (EGA) and inverse kinematics. At the same time, the kinetic constraints of the axes were set during the movement of the robot manipulators. Simulation results for the 6-DOF serial robots also demonstrate good motion performance and the effectiveness on account of EGA.",ar,2018-07-26,International Journal of Robotics and Automation,Dual-robot cooperation | Elitist genetic algorithm | Markov decision process | Reinforcement learning | Trajectory planning,2-s2.0-85050679106,,,Article,Liu Y.,60004538,Dalian University of Technology,Dalian,China,4,"Liu, Yi;Cong, Ming;Dong, Hang;Liu, Dong",57192563871;16306181000;56924174500;57137089900,60004538;60004538;60004538;60004538,26 July 2018,8268185,25482,,Journal,33,4,,367-378,0,NSFC,51575078,National Natural Science Foundation of China,3,2018,https://www.actapress.com/PaperInfo.aspx?paperId=45810,,Excluido por machine learning

Programming or reprogramming of such systems is time-consuming and requires significant efforts by number of experts. One of the solutions to this problem is to enable the robot to learn from human teacher through demonstrations or observations. This paper presents novel approach that integrates Learning from Demonstrations methodology and chaotic bioinspired optimization algorithms for reproduction of desired motion trajectories. Demonstrations of the different trajectories to reproduce are gathered by human teacher while teleoperating the mobile robot in working environment. The learning (optimization) goal is to produce such sequence of mobile robot actuator commands that generate minimal error in the final robot pose. Four different chaotic methods are implemented, namely chaotic Bat Algorithm, chaotic Firefly Algorithm, chaotic Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization and newly developed chaotic Grey Wolf Optimizer (CGWO). In order to determine the best map for CGWO, this algorithm is tested on ten benchmark problems using ten well-known chaotic maps. Simulations compare aforementioned algorithms in reproduction of two complex motion trajectories with different length and shape. Moreover, these tests include variation of population in swarm and demonstration examples. Real-world experiment on a nonholonomic mobile robot in indoor environment proves the applicability of the proposed approach.",ar,2018-08-01,Neural Computing and Applications,Bat Algorithm | Bioinspired algorithms | Chaos | Firefly Algorithm | Grey Wolf Optimizer | Learning from Demonstration | Metaheuristic optimization | Mobile robot | Particle Swarm Optimization,2-s2.0-85000997254,,,Article,Mitić M.,60068815,University of Belgrade,Belgrade,Serbia,4,"Mitić, Marko;Vuković, Najdan;Petrović, Milica;Miljković, Zoran",55149778100;55240426700;56745016500;23667778000,60068815;60068815;60068815;60068815,1 August 2018,9410643,24800,,Journal,30,4,,1065-1083,0,MPNTR,TR35004,"Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja",14,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00521-016-2717-6,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1002/rob.21767,Data-driven learning and planning for environmental sampling,"Robots such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have been used for sensing and monitoring aquatic environments such as oceans and lakes. Environmental sampling is a challenging task because the environmental attributes to be observed can vary both spatially and temporally, and the target environment is usually a large and continuous domain whereas the sampling data are typically sparse and limited. The challenges require that the sampling method must be informative and efficient enough to catch up with the environmental dynamics. In this paper, we present a planning and learning method that enables a sampling robot to perform persistent monitoring tasks by learning and refining a dynamic “data map” that models a spatiotemporal environment attribute such as ocean salinity content. Our environmental sampling framework consists of two components: To maximize the information collected, we propose an informative planning component that efficiently generates sampling waypoints that contain the maximal information; to alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data accumulated, we develop a component based on a sparse Gaussian process whose hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data that provides the greatest contribution. We validate our method with both simulations running on real ocean data and field trials with an ASV in a lake environment. Our experiments show that the proposed framework is both accurate in learning the environmental data map and efficient in catching up with the dynamic environmental changes.",ar,2018-08-01,Journal of Field Robotics,environmental monitoring | Gaussian process | informative planning | learning | marine robotics,2-s2.0-85035001913,,,Article,Ma K.C.,60029311;60010875,"University of Southern California;Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering",Los Angeles;Bloomington,United States;United States,4,"Ma, Kai Chieh;Liu, Lantao;Heidarsson, Hordur K.;Sukhatme, Gaurav S.",57192423086;56093079100;35107506200;7003730870,60029311;60010875;60029311;60029311,August 2018,15564959,4700152301,15564967,Journal,35,5,,643-661,1,NSF,2017-67007-26154,National Science Foundation,33,2018,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.21767,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1109/JPROC.2018.2849003,SMC: Satisfiability Modulo Convex Programming,"The design of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) requires methods and tools that can efficiently reason about the interaction between discrete models, e.g., representing the behaviors of 'cyber' components, and continuous models of physical processes. Boolean methods such as satisfiability (SAT) solving are successful in tackling large combinatorial search problems for the design and verification of hardware and software components. On the other hand, problems in control, communications, signal processing, and machine learning often rely on convex programming as a powerful solution engine. However, despite their strengths, neither approach would work in isolation for CPSs. In this paper, we present a new satisfiability modulo convex programming (SMC) framework that integrates SAT solving and convex optimization to efficiently reason about Boolean and convex constraints at the same time. We exploit the properties of a class of logic formulas over Boolean and nonlinear real predicates, termed monotone satisfiability modulo convex formulas, whose satisfiability can be checked via a finite number of convex programs. Following the lazy satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) paradigm, we develop a new decision procedure for monotone SMC formulas, which coordinates SAT solving and convex programming to provide a satisfying assignment or determine that the formula is unsatisfiable. A key step in our coordination scheme is the efficient generation of succinct infeasibility proofs for inconsistent constraints that can support conflict-driven learning and accelerate the search. We demonstrate our approach on different CPS design problems, including spacecraft docking mission control, robotic motion planning, and secure state estimation. We show that SMC can handle more complex problem instances than state-of-the-art alternative techniques based on SMT solving and mixed integer convex programming.",ar,2018-09-01,Proceedings of the IEEE,Cyber-physical systems | system verification | system-level design,2-s2.0-85051405342,,,Article,Shoukry Y.,60121438;60078684;60029311;60027550;60025038;60006297,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences;A.

NO,10.1109/TASE.2017.2783342,MASD: A Multimodal Assembly Skill Decoding System for Robot Programming by Demonstration,"Programming by demonstration (PBD) transforms the robot programming from the code level to automated interface between robot and human, promoting the flexibility of robotized automation. In this paper, we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal, an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill, called MASD, is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect, gesture, and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD, the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time, driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments, the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills, and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD, the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch, verifying the initial hypothesis. Note to Practitioners - In the conventional robotized automation, the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term, with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment. On the other hand, the new trend of customization brings the new characteristics: production in short cycle and small volume. This irreversible momentum urges the robot to switch from task to task efficiently. The biggest bottleneck here is the tedious programming, which also has high prerequisites for most practitioners in manufacturing. This situation motivates the development of a PBD system that can understand the assembly skills performed by the human experts in the demonstration and accordingly generate the program for robot's execution of the taught task. In this paper, we present a skill decoding system to parse the observational raw demonstration into symbolic sequences, which is the crucial bridge to enable the automatic programming. The system achieves high performance in recognition and is tailored for the PBD in assembly tasks by considering both advantages and disadvantages in the background of assembly, such as controllable environment and limited computational resources. It is particularly useful for assembly tasks with modularized actions based on a set of standard parts. At the perspective of industrial application, the PBD upon the proposed system is a promising solution to improve the flexibility of manufacture, which is expected to be true in midterm but an important step toward this goal.",ar,2018-10-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Activity recognition | robot learning | robot programming,2-s2.0-85040942552,,,Article,Wang Y.,60117978;60102726,"State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology;ABB Group, China",Hangzhou;Beijing,China;China,6,"Wang, Yue;Jiao, Yanmei;Xiong, Rong;Yu, Hongsheng;Zhang, Jiafan;Liu, Yong",57200067965;57216352160;7102951376;57200333651;55870821300;56011543900,60117978;60117978;60117978;60117978;60102726;60117978,October 2018,15455955,17340,,Journal,15,4,8263146,1722-1734,0,NSFC,61473258,National Natural Science Foundation of China,10,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8263146,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1109/LRA.2018.2856927,Efficient Sampling with Q-Learning to Guide Rapidly Exploring Random Trees,"This letter presents a novel approach for efficient sampling of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) based upon learning a state-action value function (Q-function). Our sampling method selects the optimal node to extend in the search tree via the learned state value computed from the node feature representation. Our softmax node selection procedure avoids becoming stuck at local minima and maintains the asymptotic completeness property of RRTs. We employ several features in learning the Q-function, including radial basis function (RBF) scoring of collision and collision-free regions in the configuration space. Since this approach allows the RRT to explore efficiently while avoiding obstacles via the Q-function, the RRT planner is continually adapted to the surrounding environment in an online manner.

The method learns an abstract roadmap of probability distributions for the configuration space of a particular task set from previous solution paths. We show how to construct the Repetition Roadmap by learning a Gaussian mixture model and connecting the distribution components based on the connectivity information of the prior paths. We present an algorithm that exploits the information in the Repetition Roadmap to guide the search for solutions of similar tasks.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2018.2854958,Sequence-to-Sequence model for trajectory planning of nonprehensile manipulation including contact model,"Nonprehensile manipulation is necessary for robots to operate in humans' daily lives. As nonprehensile manipulation should satisfy both kinematics and dynamics requirements simultaneously, it is difficult to manipulate objects along given paths. Previous studies have considered the problems with sequence-to-sequence models, which are neural networks for time-series conversion. However, they did not consider nonlinear contact models, such as friction models. When we train the seq2seq models using end-to-end backpropagation, training losses vanish owing to static friction. In this letter, we realize sequence-to-sequence models for trajectory planning of nonprehensile manipulation including contact models between the robots and target objects. This letter proposes a training curriculum that commences training without contact models to bring the seq2seq models outside of the gradient-vanishing zone. This letter discusses sliding manipulation, which includes a friction model between objects and tools, such as frying pans fixed onto the robots. We validated the proposed curriculum through a simulation. In addition, we observed that the trained seq2seq models could handle parameter fluctuations that did not exist during training.",ar,2018-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Deep learning in robotics and automation | motion and path planning | nonprehensile manipulation | sequence-to-sequence model,2-s2.0-85063307055,,,Article,Kutsuzawa K.,60028263,Saitama University,Saitama,Japan,3,"Kutsuzawa, Kyo;Sakaino, Sho;Tsuji, Toshiaki",57193017750;20434698200;9332772500,60028263;60028263;60028263,October 2018,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,3,4,8410030,3606-3613,1,JSPS,16H04311,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,5,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8410030,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2018.03.008,Skill-based instruction of collaborative robots in industrial settings,"During the past decades, the increasing need for more flexible and agile manufacturing equipment has spawned a growing interest in collaborative robots. Contrary to traditional industrial robots, collaborative robots are intended for operating alongside the production personnel in dynamic or semi-structured human environments. To cope with the environment and workflow of humans, new programming and control methods are needed compared to those of traditional industrial robots. This paper presents a task-level programming software tool allowing robotic novices to program industrial tasks on a collaborative robot. The tool called Skill Based System (SBS) is founded on the concept of robot skills, which are parameterizable and task-related actions of the robot. Task programming is conducted by first sequencing skills followed by an online parameterization performed using kinesthetic teaching. Through several user studies, SBS is found to enable robotic novices to program industrial tasks. SBS has further been deployed and tested in two manufacturing settings demonstrating its applicability in real industrial scenarios.",ar,2018-10-01,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,Collaborative robots | Industrial assembly | Intuitive robot instruction | Robot skills | Task-level programming,2-s2.0-85044441207,S0736584516301910,,Article,Schou C.,60022134,Aalborg University,Aalborg,Denmark,5,"Schou, Casper;Andersen, Rasmus Skovgaard;Chrysostomou, Dimitrios;Bøgh, Simon;Madsen, Ole",56023056800;17433695800;24477398900;35760920300;26421715700,60022134;60022134;60022134;60022134;60022134,October 2018,7365845,18080,,Journal,53,,,72-80,0,FP7,600578,Seventh Framework Programme,46,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736584516301910?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

This article first realizes a cyberphysical avatar that integrates three key technologies: Body-compliant control, neuroevolution, and real-time constraints. Body-compliant control is essential for operator safety, because avatars perform cooperative tasks in close proximity to humans; neuroevolution (NEAT) enables ""programming"" avatars such that they can be used by non-experts for a large array of tasks, some unforeseen, in an unstructured environment; and real-time constraints are indispensable to provide predictable, bounded-time response in human-avatar interaction. Then, we present a study on the tradeoffs between three design parameters for robotic task systems that must incorporate at least three dimensions: (1) the amount of training effort for robot to perform the task, (2) the time available to complete the task when the command is given, and (3) the quality of the result of the performed task. A tradeoff study in this design space by using the imprecise computation as a framework is to perform a common robotic task, specifically, grasping of unknown objects.

This model is used to capture the dynamics of the micropart and its interaction with the environment such as frictional contacts and other uncertainties that are difficult to model explicitly. The push manipulation is done using probes attached to micromanipulators capable of high-resolution movements. The setup is demonstrated through simulations using two manipulators and a LEGO inspired micropart as it is pushed through different trajectories. Experiments include performing push manipulations in the presence of obstacles, with single and multiple manipulators, and demonstrating the use of the system to perform a microassembly task.

NO,10.1088/1741-2552/aae186,Gumpy: A Python toolbox suitable for hybrid brain-computer interfaces,"Objective. The objective of this work is to present gumpy, a new free and open source Python toolbox designed for hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI). Approach. Gumpy provides state-of-the-art algorithms and includes a rich selection of signal processing methods that have been employed by the BCI community over the last 20 years. In addition, a wide range of classification methods that span from classical machine learning algorithms to deep neural network models are provided. Gumpy can be used for both EEG and EMG biosignal analysis, visualization, real-time streaming and decoding. Results. The usage of the toolbox was demonstrated through two different offline example studies, namely movement prediction from EEG motor imagery, and the decoding of natural grasp movements with the applied finger forces from surface EMG (sEMG) signals. Additionally, gumpy was used for real-time control of a robot arm using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) as well as for real-time prosthetic hand control using sEMG. Overall, obtained results with the gumpy toolbox are comparable or better than previously reported results on the same datasets. Significance. Gumpy is a free and open source software, which allows end-users to perform online hybrid BCIs and provides different techniques for processing and decoding of EEG and EMG signals. More importantly, the achieved results reveal that gumpy's deep learning toolbox can match or outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. This can therefore enable BCI researchers to develop more robust decoding algorithms using novel techniques and hence chart a route ahead for new BCI improvements.",ar,2018-10-10,Journal of Neural Engineering,deep learning | EEG | EMG | hybrid brain-computer interfaces | Python,2-s2.0-85056658695,,30215610,Article,Tayeb Z.,60117641;60019722;60007798;121944512,"Fakultät für Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik, Technische Universität München;Technical University of Munich;Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- Und Raumfahrt;Integrated Research",Munich;Munich; Cologne;Sydney,Germany;Germany;Germany;Australia,11,"Tayeb, Zied;Waniek, Nicolai;Fedjaev, Juri;Ghaboosi, Nejla;Rychly, Leonard;Widderich, Christian;Richter, Christoph;Braun, Jonas;Saveriano, Matteo;Cheng, Gordon;Conradt, Jörg",57195526275;56338432400;57192818799;16645667600;57204669742;57204675361;56646803000;57204664263;55556026600;10243873000;13005140400,60117641-60019722;60117641;60117641;121944512;60117641;60117641;60117641;60117641;60007798;60019722;60117641,10 October 2018,17412560,130164,17412552,Journal,15,6,65003,,0,,undefined,,19,2018,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aae186,,Excluido por nada que ver (brain-computer interfaces?)

Furthermore, teasing out the individualistic and anti-authority threads in this project and its links to present day narratives of technology development exposes the deeply atomized and even oppositional notions of collaboration in these projects and others under the auspices of CSCW today that draw on early notions of ‘hacker culture.’ These notions tend to favor a limited view of work, learning, and practice—an invisible constraint that continues to inform how we build and evaluate CSCW technologies.",ar,2018-11-01,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,AI | Constructionism | Education | FabLabs | Hackers | Ideology | Learning | Logo | Maker Movement | Media Lab | Mindstorms | MIT | OLPC | Piaget | Robotics | Scaffolding | School | Scratch | Seymour Papert | Teachers,2-s2.0-85066418056,,,Article,Ames M.G.,60121393,"Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, &amp; Society",Berkeley,United States,1,"Ames, Morgan G.",7004988683,60121393,November 2018,,21100908414,25730142,Journal,2,CSCW,18,,0,,undefined,,14,2018,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274287,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l4Xlc8ozYDEIxmB0dvBaUuX8Cw60S13T/view?usp=sharing,"Revisar si habla de robótica

The educational process is frequently supported by formal lecture approaches assisted by object lessons or lab activities, and project-based learning methodologies where students engage complex questions, challenges, and problems over a longer period of time. These educational approaches are not effective when applying to learners in robotics study programs or without a programming background where time and motivation are different. To address this concern, this paper presents an educational tool developed to teach the basic principles of machine vision and image processing through the design of short case studies. As the main contribution, the proposed tool allows to shorten the training time required by students—mainly beginners—without the skills in programming and deep understanding of math hidden behind each image operation. This lets to fit theoretical and practical works into short development times. To this end, we conducted an educational experience in robotics subjects with third year students of the computer science and industrial engineering degrees.

NO,10.1007/s11277-018-5479-x,ALIC: A Low Overhead Compiler Optimization Prediction Model,"Iterative compilation based on machine learning can automatically predict the best optimization for the new programs. However, the efficient prediction models often require repetitive training, which leads to a higher training time overheads, and greatly affects the widespread utilization of the technology. The existing approaches in the prediction model construction often use random sample search strategy, which easily lead to data redundancy. In addition, due to the effect of run-time noises, the sample program is subjected to a fixed number of repetitive observations. However, in the case there is very little noises, the repetitive observations will result in a serious waste of iterative compilation time overheads. Therefore, how to effectively collect the optimal prediction model samples and choose the appropriate sample observations number are the key problem of reducing the iterative compilation overheads. We propose a low overheads iterative compilation optimization parameters prediction model ALIC. First, we describe the target programs by static-dynamic features representation based on feature-class relevance, and construct an initial optimization prediction model by the classifier. Then we use a dynamic number of sample observations strategy for each sample. The most profitable sample from the candidate samples set is selected and marked, each mark is equivalent to increase the number of sample observations. Finally, the optimization prediction model is constructed based on the intermediate prediction model that learns candidate samples actively. The experimental results show that when predicting optimization parameters for the new programs on Intel Xeon E5520 and Chinese Shenwei 26010 platforms, the ALIC model generates 1.38× (by ICC14.0 compiler), 1.35× (by GCC5.4 compiler) average performance improvement on the Xeon platform, and 1.42× (by SW compiler) on the Shenwei Platform.

NO,10.1109/TII.2018.2800744,Integrating different levels of automation: Lessons from winning the amazon robotics challenge 2016,"This paper describes Team Delft's robot winning the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2016. The competition involves automating pick and place operations in semistructured environments, specifically the shelves in an Amazon warehouse. Team Delft's entry demonstrated that the current robot technology can already address most of the challenges in product handling: object recognition, grasping, motion, or task planning; under broad yet bounded conditions. The system combines an industrial robot arm, 3-D cameras and a custom gripper. The robot's software is based on the robot operating system to implement solutions based on deep learning and other state-of-The-Art artificial intelligence techniques, and to integrate them with off-The-shelf components. From the experience developing the robotic system, it was concluded that: 1) the specific task conditions should guide the selection of the solution for each capability required; 2) understanding the characteristics of the individual solutions and the assumptions they embed is critical to integrate a performing system from them; and 3) this characterization can be based on 'levels of robot automation.' This paper proposes automation levels based on the usage of information at design or runtime to drive the robot's behavior, and uses them to discuss Team Delft's design solution and the lessons learned from this robot development experience.",ar,2018-11-01,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,Grasping | Manipulators | Motion planning | Object recognition | Robot control,2-s2.0-85042863706,,,Article,Corbato C.,60118246,TU Delft Robotics Institute,Delft,Netherlands,5,"Corbato, Carlos Hernandez;Bharatheesha, Mukunda;Van Egmond, Jeff;Ju, Jihong;Wisse, Martijn",55263518800;56423724100;56735972100;57197736680;8578990300,60118246;60118246;60118246;60118246;60118246,November 2018,15513203,144912,,Journal,14,11,8304784,4916-4926,1,,FP7-609206,,18,2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8304784,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.3390/s18113818,Real evaluations tractability using continuous goal-directed actions in smart city applications,"One of the most important challenges of Smart City Applications is to adapt the system to interact with non-expert users. Robot imitation frameworks aim to simplify and reduce times of robot programming by allowing users to program directly through action demonstrations. In classical robot imitation frameworks, actions are modelled using joint or Cartesian space trajectories. They accurately describe actions where geometrical characteristics are relevant, such as fixed trajectories from one pose to another. Other features, such as visual ones, are not always well represented with these pure geometrical approaches. Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is an alternative to these conventional methods, as it encodes actions as changes of any selected feature that can be extracted from the environment. As a consequence of this, the robot joint trajectories for execution must be fully computed to comply with this feature-agnostic encoding. This is achieved using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which usually requires too many evaluations to perform this evolution step in the actual robot. The current strategies involve performing evaluations in a simulated environment, transferring only the final joint trajectory to the actual robot. Smart City applications involve working in highly dynamic and complex environments, where having a precise model is not always achievable. Our goal is to study the tractability of performing these evaluations directly in a real-world scenario. Two different approaches to reduce the number of evaluations using EA, are proposed and compared. In the first approach, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based methods have been studied and compared within the CGDA framework: naïve PSO, Fitness Inheritance PSO (FI-PSO), and Adaptive Fuzzy Fitness Granulation with PSO (AFFG-PSO). The second approach studied the introduction of geometrical and velocity constraints within the CGDA framework. The effects of both approaches were analyzed and compared in the “wax” and “paint” actions, two CGDA commonly studied use cases. Results from this paper depict an important reduction in the number of required evaluations.",ar,2018-11-07,Sensors (Switzerland),CGDA | Constraints | Evaluations | Evolutionary algorithms | Fitness inheritance | Humanoids robots | LfD | PbD | PSO | Real world | Smart city,2-s2.0-85056315648,,30405084,Article,Fernandez-Fernandez R.,60001741,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Madrid,Spain,4,"Fernandez-Fernandez, Raul;Victores, Juan G.;Estevez, David;Balaguer, Carlos",57195303930;36716896800;57136692300;6701864168,60001741;60001741;60001741;60001741,7 November 2018,14248220,130124,,Journal,18,11,3818,,1,,undefined,,1,2018,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/11/3818,,Excluido por nada que ver (smart cities?)
NO,10.1177/0278364918781001,Data-driven planning via imitation learning,"Robot planning is the process of selecting a sequence of actions that optimize for a task=specific objective. For instance, the objective for a navigation task would be to find collision-free paths, whereas the objective for an exploration task would be to map unknown areas. The optimal solutions to such tasks are heavily influenced by the implicit structure in the environment, i.e. the configuration of objects in the world. State-of-the-art planning approaches, however, do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable effort searching the action space instead of focusing on potentially good actions. In this paper, we address the problem of enabling planners to adapt their search strategies by inferring such good actions in an efficient manner using only the information uncovered by the search up until that time. We formulate this as a problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty where at a given iteration a planning policy must map the state of the search to a planning action. Unfortunately, the training process for such partial-information-based policies is slow to converge and susceptible to poor local minima. Our key insight is that if we could fully observe the underlying world map, we would easily be able to disambiguate between good and bad actions. We hence present a novel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently train planning policies by imitating a clairvoyant oracle: an oracle that at train time has full knowledge about the world map and can compute optimal decisions. We leverage the fact that for planning problems, such oracles can be efficiently computed and derive performance guarantees for the learnt policy. We examine two important domains that rely on partial-information-based policies: informative path planning and search-based motion planning. We validate the approach on a spectrum of environments for both problem domains, including experiments on a real UAV, and show that the learnt policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Our framework is able to train policies that achieve up to 39% more reward than state-of-the art information-gathering heuristics and a 70 x speedup as compared with A* on search-based planning problems. Our approach paves the way forward for applying data-driven techniques to other such problem domains under the umbrella of robot planning.",ar,2018-12-01,International Journal of Robotics Research,heuristic search | Imitation learning | POMDPs | QMDPs | sequential decision making,2-s2.0-85049862755,,,Article,Choudhury S.,60027950;60021726,Carnegie Mellon University;Microsoft Research,Pittsburgh;Redmond,United States;United States,7,"Choudhury, Sanjiban;Bhardwaj, Mohak;Arora, Sankalp;Kapoor, Ashish;Ranade, Gireeja;Scherer, Sebastian;Dey, Debadeepta",55842232500;57213488499;55922065800;36856640700;34873308100;15846506300;53863310500,60027950;60027950;60027950;60021726;60021726;60027950;60021726,1 December 2018,2783649,18050,17413176,Journal,37,13-14,,1632-1672,1,ONR,N000141310821,Office of Naval Research,10,2018,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364918781001,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1016/j.swevo.2018.03.014,Synergism of Firefly Algorithm and Q-Learning for Robot Arm Path Planning,"Over the past few decades, Firefly Algorithm (FA) has attracted the attention of many researchers by virtue of its capability of solving complex real-world optimization problems. The only factor restricting the efficiency of this FA algorithm is the need of having balanced exploration and exploitation while searching for the global optima in the search-space. This balance can be established by tuning the two inherent control parameters of FA. One is the randomization parameter and another is light absorption coefficient, over iterations, either experimentally or by an automatic adaptive strategy. This paper aims at the later by proposing an improvised FA which involves the Q-learning framework within itself. In this proposed Q-learning induced FA (QFA), the optimal parameter values for each firefly of a population are learnt by the Q-learning strategy during the learning phase and applied thereafter during execution. The proposed algorithm has been simulated on fifteen benchmark functions suggested in the CEC 2015 competition. In addition, the proposed algorithm's superiority is tested by conducting the Friedman test, Iman–Davenport and Bonferroni Dunn test. Moreover, its suitability for application in real-world constrained environments has been examined by employing the algorithm in the path planning of a robotic manipulator amidst various obstacles. To avoid obstacles one mechanism is designed for the robot-arm. The results, obtained from both simulation and real-world experiment, confirm the superiority of the proposed QFA over other contender algorithms in terms of solution quality as well as run-time complexity.",ar,2018-12-01,Swarm and Evolutionary Computation,Firefly Algorithm | Path planning | Q-learning | Robot arm,2-s2.0-85056790641,S2210650217306776,,Article,Sadhu A.K.,60024948;60020825,"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata;Jadavpur University",Kolkata;Kolkata,India;India,4,"Sadhu, Arup Kumar;Konar, Amit;Bhattacharjee, Tanuka;Das, Swagatam",54895488900;7004422312;57224764708;24729258600,60020825;60020825;60020825;60024948,December 2018,22106502,19900192513,,Journal,43,,,50-68,0,UGC,undefined,University Grants Committee,31,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210650217306776?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1007/s10846-017-0739-7,Experience Learning From Basic Patterns for Efficient Robot Navigation in Indoor Environments,"In this paper we propose a machine learning technique for real-time robot path planning for an autonomous robot in a planar environment with obstacles where the robot possess no a priori map of its environment. Our main insight in this paper is that a robot’s path planning times can be significantly reduced if it can refer to previous maneuvers it used to avoid obstacles during earlier missions, and adapt that information to avoid obstacles during its current navigation. We propose an online path planning algorithm called LearnerRRT that utilizes a pattern matching technique called Sample Consensus Initial Alignment (SAC-IA) in combination with an experience-based learning technique to adapt obstacle boundary patterns encountered in previous environments to the current scenario followed by corresponding adaptations in the obstacle-avoidance paths. Our proposed algorithm LearnerRRT works as a learning-based reactive path planning technique which enables robots to improve their overall path planning performance by locally improving maneuvers around commonly encountered obstacle patterns by accessing previously accumulated environmental information. We have conducted several experiments in simulations and hardware to verify the performance of the LearnerRRT algorithm and compared it with a state-of-the-art sampling-based planner. LearnerRRT on average takes approximately 10% of the planning time and 14% of the total time taken by the sampling-based planner to solve the same navigation task based on simulation results and takes only 33% of the planning time, 46% of total time and 95% of total distance compared to the sampling-based planner based on our hardware results.",ar,2018-12-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,Experience learning | Obstacle feature matching | Real-time robot path planning,2-s2.0-85034583395,,,Article,Saha O.,60018988,University of Nebraska at Omaha,Omaha,United States,2,"Saha, Olimpiya;Dasgupta, Prithviraj",57188823078;7201405936,60018988;60018988,1 December 2018,9210296,24360,15730409,Journal,92,3-4,,545-564,0,,undefined,,4,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10846-017-0739-7,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1186/s40648-018-0120-z,Design of robot programming software for the systematic reuse of teaching data including environment model,"The motion of the robot to realize assembly work includes the part where the reuse of the motion adjusted for the real objects is effective and the part where automatic generation in the simulator is suitable. In order to smoothly teach such assembly work, teaching software that enables to combine previously used motions and perform overall adjustment of the workflow and integrated environment representation in the simulator is expected. Some teaching tools focus on the function of making robot motion in detail, and it assumes that the adjustment of the whole workflow including system layout using the real work environment. For this reason, the environmental expression is not sufficient for the above purpose. Although offline teaching tools and motion planning tools are rich in the representation of the environment, there are not many studies on a systematic reuse mechanism of motions adjusted in a real environment, including environment representations. In this paper, we present software design to solve this problem and the implementation of it as a plugin for Choreonoid.

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2018.08.016,Context-aware 3D object anchoring for mobile robots,"A world model representing the elements in a robot's environment needs to maintain a correspondence between the objects being observed and their internal representations, which is known as the anchoring problem. Anchoring is a key aspect for an intelligent robot operation, since it enables high-level functions such as task planning and execution. This work presents an anchoring system that continually integrates new observations from a 3D object recognition algorithm into a probabilistic world model. Our system takes advantage of the contextual relations inherent to human-made spaces in order to improve the classification results of the baseline object recognition system. To achieve that, the system builds a graph-based world model containing the objects in the scene (both in the current and previously perceived observations), which is exploited by a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) in order to leverage contextual information during recognition. The world model also enables the system to exploit information about objects beyond the current field of view of the robot sensors. Most importantly, this is done in an online fashion, overcoming both the disadvantages of single-shot recognition systems (e.g., limited sensor aperture) and offline recognition systems that require prior registration of all frames of a scene (e.g., dynamic scenes, unsuitability for plan-based robot control). We also propose a novel way to include the outcome of local object recognition methods in the PGM, which results in a decrease in the usually high model learning complexity and an increase in the system performance. The system performance has been assessed with a dataset collected by a mobile robot from restaurant-like settings, obtaining positive results for both its data association and object recognition capabilities. The system has been successfully used in the RACE robotic architecture.",ar,2018-12-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Anchoring | Conditional random fields | Context-aware anchoring | Data association | Mobile robotics | World modeling,2-s2.0-85053797358,S0921889017307856,,Article,Günther M.,60075096;60009731;60003662,German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI);Universität Osnabrück;Universidad de Málaga,Kaiserslautern;Osnabruck;Malaga,Germany;Germany;Spain,5,"Günther, Martin;Ruiz-Sarmiento, J.

NO,10.1108/IR-06-2018-0120,Application of mixed reality in robot manipulator programming,"Purpose: Mixed reality is expanding in the industrial market and several companies in various fields are adapting this set of technologies for various purposes, such as optimizing processes, improving the programming tasks and promoting the interactivity of their products with the users, or even improving teaching or training. Robotics is another area that can benefit from these recent technologies. In fact, most of the current and futuristic robotic applications, namely, the areas related to advanced manufacturing tasks (e.g. additive-manufacturing, collaborative robotics, etc.), require new technics to actually perceive the result of several actions, including programming tasks, anticipate trajectories, visualize the motion and related information, interface with programmers and users and several other human–machine interfaces. Consequently, this paper aims to explain a new concept of human–machine interfaces aiming to improve the interaction between advanced users and industrial robotic work cells. Design/methodology/approach: The presented concept uses two different applications (apps) developed to explore the advanced features of the Microsoft HoloLens device. The objectives of the project reported in this paper are to optimize robot paths, just by allowing the advanced user to adjust the selected path through the mixed reality environment, and create new paths, just by allowing the advanced user to insert points in the mixed reality environment, correct them as needed, connect them using a certain type of motion, parametrize them (in terms of velocity, motion precision, etc.) and command them to the robot controller. Findings: The solutions demonstrated in this paper show how mixed reality can be used to allow users, with limited programming experience, to fully use the robotics fields. They also show clearly that the integration of the mixed reality technology in the current robot systems will be a turning point in reducing the complexity for end-users. Research limitations/implications: There are two challenges in the developed applications. The first relates to the robot tool identification, which is very sensitive to lighting conditions or to very complex robot tools. This can result in positioning errors when the software shows the path in the mixed reality scene. The paper presents solutions to overcome this problem. Another unattended challenge is associated with handling the robot singularities when adjusting or creating new paths. Ongoing work is concentrated in creating mechanisms that prevent the end-user to create paths that contain unreachable points or paths that are not feasible because of bad motion parameters. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates the utilization of mixed reality device to improve the tasks of programming and commanding manufacturing work cells based on industrial robots [see video in (Pires et al., 2018)]. As the presented devices and robot cells are the basis for Industry 4.0 objectives, this demonstration has a vast field of application in the near future, positively influencing the way complex applications, that require much close cooperation between humans and machines, are thought, planned and built. The paper presents two different applications fully ready to use in industrial environments. These applications are scientific experiments designed to demonstrate the principles and technologies of mixed reality applied to industrial robotics, namely, for improving the programming task. Social implications: Although the HoloLens device opens outstanding new areas for robot command and programming, it is still expensive and somehow heavy for everyday use. Consequently, this opens an opportunity window to combine these devices with other mobile devices, such as tablets and phones, building applications that take advantage of their combined features. Originality/value: The paper presents two different applications fully ready to use in industrial environments. These applications are scientific experiments designed to demonstrate the principles and technologies of mixed reality applied to industrial robotics, namely, for improving the programming task. The first application is about path visualization, i.e. enables the user to visualize, in a mixed reality environment, any path preplanned for the robot cell. With this feature, the advanced user can follow the robot path, identify problems, associate any difficulty in the final product with a particular issue in the robot paths, anticipate execution problems with impact on the final product quality, etc. This is particularly important for not only advanced applications, but also for cases where the robot path results from a CAD package (in an offline fashion). The second application consists of a graphical path manipulation procedure that allows the advanced user to create and optimize a robot path. Just by exploring this feature, the end-user can adjust any path obtained from any programming method, using the mixed reality approach to guide (visually) the path manipulation procedure. It can also create a completely new path using a process of graphical insertion of point positions and paths into the mixed reality scene. The ideas and implementations of the paper are original and there is no other example in the literature applied to industrial robot programming.",ar,2018-12-07,Industrial Robot,Augmented reality | Graphical path manipulation | HoloLens | Industrial Robotics | Mixed Reality | Path visualization,2-s2.0-85058018578,,,Article,Neves J.,60106451,"University of Coimbra, Centre for Mechanical Engineering, Materials and Processes",Coimbra,Portugal,3,"Neves, João;Serrario, Diogo;Pires, J.

The application focuses on the basics of programming such as data types, variables, and control structures using the Python programming language through a simple, attractive, and age-appropriate design. The application presents its users with an interesting storyline that involves a trip to space with “Labeeb”, a robot character designed to explain programming concepts to the child throughout the trip. Each planet represents a level in the application and introduces a programming concept through a set of lessons and exercises. The application can be used by educational institutions and parents to teach programming and will provide an opportunity through which Arabic-speaking children can keep up with the development and dissemination of technology.",ar,2019-01-01,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,,2-s2.0-85070076205,,,Article,Almanie T.,,King Saud University,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,,,,,2019,2158107X,21100867241,21565570,Journal,10,7,,413-418,1,,,,0,2019,https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=10&Issue=7&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=57,,Excluido por no robótica (tiene un robot virtual la app)

The heuristic information of each vertex is a set composed of its possible path length values from the starting vertex, which is obtained by the path length extension algorithm. A detailed analysis of algorithm examples shows that the heuristic algorithm can greatly reduce the number of processing nodes compared to the backtracking algorithm without information; meanwhile, the algorithm’s time complexity is related to the number of loops in the directed graph. If a directed graph G(V, E) only contains loops that contain the starting point, then the Hamiltonian problem of G can be determined in polynomial time. The algorithm is implemented using C++ and Python programming, and all of the test graphs are generated by the random graph algorithm. The experiments show that the heuristic algorithm can reduce the number of extended nodes by at least 10% in directed random graphs with no or only a few loops. This heuristic algorithm can save time in applications that perform tasks while extending nodes because it reduce the number of extended nodes.",ar,2019-01-01,Wireless Networks,,2-s2.0-85074580915,,,Article,Jin D.,,Zhongnan University of Economics and Law,Wuhan,China,,,,,2019,10220038,17569,15728196,Journal,,,,,0,,,,0,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11276-019-02140-1,,Excluido por nada que ver
NO,10.1109/TII.2017.2786280,Designing Dynamic and Collaborative Automation and Robotics Software Systems,"The heterogeneity of execution platforms and operating software in manufacturing machines and robots, as well as various sensors and actuators, creates challenges for integration into larger systems. Existing approaches make use of different types of middleware to mitigate the challenges of designing interoperable systems. However, middleware can significantly impede modular design and composition of software systems that are dynamic in nature. This paper elaborates upon those challenges and proposes using an approach called service-oriented SystemJ (SOSJ), based on the system-level programming language SystemJ enhanced with service oriented features. This approach allows developers to design dynamic software systems while adopting and incorporating legacy solutions. The approach is demonstrated on the integration of an industrial automation system, incorporating the use of multiple modular mechatronics stations and service robotics systems, represented by robot operating system-enabled Baxter robots. The proposed approach offers a simple service interface based on abstract objects for integrating robots and automation machines in the SOSJ world, without the need to modify the underlying mechatronics or robotics systems.",ar,2019-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,2-s2.0-85039808369,,,Article,Salcic Z.,,The University of Auckland,Auckland,New Zealand,,,,,January 2019,15513203,144912,,Journal,15,1,8234634,540-549,0,,,,11,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8234634,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1017/S1471068418000054,Multi-shot ASP solving with clingo,"We introduce a new flexible paradigm of grounding and solving in Answer Set Programming (ASP), which we refer to as multi-shot ASP solving, and present its implementation in the ASP system clingo. Multi-shot ASP solving features grounding and solving processes that deal with continuously changing logic programs. In doing so, they remain operative and accommodate changes in a seamless way. For instance, such processes allow for advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or interaction with an environment, as in robotics or query answering. Common to them is that the problem specification evolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are added, deleted, or replaced. This evolutionary aspect adds another dimension to ASP since it brings about state changing operations. We address this issue by providing an operational semantics that characterizes grounding and solving processes in multi-shot ASP solving. This characterization provides a semantic account of grounder and solver states along with the operations manipulating them. The operative nature of multi-shot solving avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits from the solver's learning capacities. clingo accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language with control capacities. On the declarative side, a new directive allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and fully controllable from the procedural side. To this end, clingo offers a new application programming interface that is conveniently accessible via scripting languages. By strictly separating logic and control, clingo also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.",ar,2019-01-01,Theory and Practice of Logic Programming,,2-s2.0-85049847869,S1471068418000054,,Article,Gebser M.,,Universität Potsdam,Potsdam,Germany,,,,,1 January 2019,14710684,28424,14753081,Journal,19,1,,27-82,0,,,,41,2019,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/article/abs/multishot-asp-solving-with-clingo/FAED3429900D84CDD5155326A36548F2,,Excluido por nada que ver
NO,10.3390/en12071229,Optimal design of wireless charging electric bus system based on reinforcement learning,"The design of conventional electric vehicles (EVs) is affected by numerous limitations, such as a short travel distance and long charging time. As one of the first wireless charging systems, the Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV) was developed to overcome the limitations of the current generation of EVs. Using wireless charging, an electric vehicle can be charged by power cables embedded in the road. In this paper, a model and algorithm for the optimal design of a wireless charging electric bus system is proposed. The model is built using a Markov decision process and is used to verify the optimal number of power cables, as well as optimal pickup capacity and battery capacity. Using reinforcement learning, the optimization problem of a wireless charging electric bus system in a diverse traffic environment is then solved. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm maximizes average reward and minimizes total cost. We show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with obtaining the exact solution via mixed integer programming (MIP).

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960859,Intelligent path planning for auvs in dynamic environments: An eda-based learning fixed height histogram approach,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robots that require path planning to complete missions in different kinds of underwater environments. The goal of path planning is to find a feasible path from the start-point to the target-point in a given environment. In most practical applications, environments have dynamic factors, such as ocean flows and moving obstacles, which make the AUV path planning more challenging. This paper proposes an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based approach, termed as learning fixed-height histogram (LFHH) to solve path planning problems for AUVs in dynamic environment. The LFHH uses a learning transformation strategy (LTS) to improve its accuracy and convergence speed. Besides, a smooth method is employed to accelerate the speed of finding feasible paths. Moreover, a planning window is adopted to help handle dynamic factors. LFHH is tested in both complex 2-D and 3-D environments with time-variant dynamic factors, and experimental results validate the effectiveness of LFHH.",ar,2019-01-01,IEEE Access,,2-s2.0-85078048883,,,Article,Liu R.D.,,South China University of Technology,Guangzhou,China,,,,,2019,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,7,,8936928,185433-185446,1,,,,6,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936928,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.3390/s19010176,Towards goal-directed navigation through combining learning based global and local planners,"Robot navigation is a fundamental problem in robotics and various approaches have been developed to cope with this problem. Despite the great success of previous approaches, learning-based methods are receiving growing interest in the research community. They have shown great efficiency in solving navigation tasks and offer considerable promise to build intelligent navigation systems. This paper presents a goal-directed robot navigation system that integrates global planning based on goal-directed end-to-end learning and local planning based on reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed system aims to navigate the robot to desired goal positions while also being adaptive to changes in the environment. The global planner is trained to imitate an expert’s navigation between different positions by goal-directed end-to-end learning, where both the goal representations and local observations are incorporated to generate actions. However, it is trained in a supervised fashion and is weak in dealing with changes in the environment. To solve this problem, a local planner based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is designed. The local planner is first implemented in a simulator and then transferred to the real world. It works complementarily to deal with situations that have not been met during training the global planner and is able to generalize over different situations. The experimental results on a robot platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed navigation system.

In this way, the autonomy of robot manipulation will be greatly improved in an environment with unstructured constraints. In this paper, a method is proposed to obtain the articulated objects' constraint model by learning from a one-shot continuous visual demonstration which contains multistep movements, and this enables human teacher to continuously demonstrate several tasks at once without manual segmentation.

This study focuses on the integration of a disciplinarily-integrated game, SURGE NextG, with complementary model-based activities to support the development of scientific modeling in Newtonian mechanics. Two pedagogical approaches were designed. Students in both approaches modeled the motion of an object inside and outside the game environment. One approach involved the material integration of virtual game play through a physical modeling activity in the classroom. The second approach involved a complementary modeling tool using an agent-based computational programming platform. While both modeling activities demonstrated affordances to support productive student learning, this study highlights the significance of designing multiple complementary representations of the same phenomenon as a core element of game play and related modeling activities.

In this paper, we propose an efficient feature extractor named linear dynamic systems based fuzzy C-means method (LDS) to encode the tactile sequences, both spatially and temporally. To this end, we decompose every input sequence into multiple subsequences, each of which is locally described by a finite-ordered observability matrix of the LDS model. A fuzzy c-means method is then applied to cluster the local LDS descriptors for learning a codebook. Conditioned on the resulting codebook, the global tactile representation is formulated by employing two different frameworks to integrate the subsequences within each tactile sequence, namely, the Vector of locally aggregated descriptor and Bag-of-Word approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by a variety of experimental evaluations on five benchmark datasets. Results reveal that our proposed method achieves a higher classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art models with a large margin.",ar,2019-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,,2-s2.0-85050633474,,,Article,Liu C.,,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,,,,,January 2019,10636706,24242,,Journal,27,1,8418835,72-83,0,,,,14,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8418835,,Excluido por nada que ver
NO,10.1145/3281629,Representations and optimizations for embedded parallel dataflow languages,"Parallel dataflow engines such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink are an established alternative to relational databases for modern data analysis applications. A characteristic of these systems is a scalable programming model based on distributed collections and parallel transformations expressed by means of second-order functions such as map and reduce. Notable examples are Flink’s DataSet and Spark’s RDD programming abstractions. These programming models are realized as EDSLs—domain specific languages embedded in a general-purpose host language such as Java, Scala, or Python. This approach has several advantages over traditional external DSLs such as SQL or XQuery. First, syntactic constructs from the host language (e.g., anonymous functions syntax, value definitions, and fluent syntax via method chaining) can be reused in the EDSL. This eases the learning curve for developers already familiar with the host language. Second, it allows for seamless integration of library methods written in the host language via the function parameters passed to the parallel dataflow operators. This reduces the effort for developing analytics dataflows that go beyond pure SQL and require domain-specific logic.

At the same time, however, state-of-the-art parallel dataflow EDSLs exhibit a number of shortcomings. First, one of the main advantages of an external DSL such as SQL—the high-level, declarative Select-From-Where syntax—is either lost completely or mimicked in a non-standard way. Second, execution aspects such as caching, join order, and partial aggregation have to be decided by the programmer. Optimizing them automatically is very difficult due to the limited program context available in the intermediate representation of the DSL.

In this article, we argue that the limitations listed above are a side effect of the adopted type-based embedding approach. As a solution, we propose an alternative EDSL design based on quotations. We present a DSL embedded in Scala and discuss its compiler pipeline, intermediate representation, and some of the enabled optimizations. We promote the algebraic type of bags in union representation as a model for distributed collections and its associated structural recursion scheme and monad as a model for parallel collection processing. At the source code level, Scala’s comprehension syntax over a bag monad can be used to encode Select-From-Where expressions in a standard way. At the intermediate representation level, maintaining comprehensions as a first-class citizen can be used to simplify the design and implementation of holistic dataflow optimizations that accommodate for nesting and control-flow. The proposed DSL design therefore reconciles the benefits of embedded parallel dataflow DSLs with the declarativity and optimization potential of external DSLs like SQL.",ar,2019-01-01,ACM Transactions on Database Systems,,2-s2.0-85061210087,,,Article,Alexandrov A.,,Technical University of Berlin,Berlin,Germany,,,,,January 2019,3625915,13044,15574644,Journal,44,1,4,,0,,,,4,2019,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3281629,,Excluido por nada que ver (aunque es interesante: habla de DSLs)

This article aims to solve the two key problems of close proximity navigation—localizing tower and simultaneously estimating the unmanned aerial vehicle positions. To this end, we propose a novel monocular vision–based environmental perception approach and implement it in a hierarchical embedded unmanned aerial vehicle system. The proposed framework comprises tower localization and an improved point–line-based simultaneous localization and mapping framework consisting of feature matching, frame tracking, local mapping, loop closure, and nonlinear optimization. To enhance frame association, the prominent line feature of tower is heuristically extracted and matched followed by the intersections of lines are processed as the point feature. Then, the bundle adjustment optimization leverages the intersections of lines and the point-to-line distance to improve the accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle localization. For tower localization, a transmission tower data set is created and a concise deep learning-based neural network is designed to perform real-time and accurate tower detection. Then, it is in combination with a keyframe-based semi-dense mapping to locate the tower with a clear line-shaped structure in 3-D space. Additionally, two reasonable paths are planned for the refined inspection. In experiments, the whole unmanned aerial vehicle system developed on Robot Operating System framework is evaluated along the paths both in a synthetic scene and in a real-world inspection environment.

Because of the tremendous research that focuses on human brains and reinforcement learning, scientists have investigated how robots can autonomously tackle complex tasks in the form of making a self-driving agent control in a human-like way. In this study, we propose an end-to-end architecture using novel deep-Q-network architecture in conjunction with a recurrence to resolve the problem in the field of simulated self-driving. The main contribution of this study is that we trained the driving agent using a brain-inspired trial-and-error technique, which was in line with the real world situation. Besides, there are three innovations in the proposed learning network: raw screen outputs are the only information which the driving agent can rely on, a weighted layer that enhances the differences of the lengthy episode, and a modified replay mechanism that overcomes the problem of sparsity and accelerates learning. The proposed network was trained and tested under a third-party OpenAI Gym environment. After training for several episodes, the resulting driving agent performed advanced behaviors in the given scene. We hope that in the future, the proposed brain-inspired learning system would inspire practicable self-driving control solutions.",ar,2019-01-01,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,,2-s2.0-85068581706,,,Article,Chen J.,,Tongji University,Shanghai,China,,,,,2019,,21100199837,16625218,Journal,13,,40,,1,,,,5,2019,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2019.00040/full,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1515/pjbr-2019-0025,Teaching semantics and skills for human-robot collaboration,"Recent advances in robotics allow for collaboration between humans and machines in performing tasks at home or in industrial settings without harming the life ofthe user. While humans can easily adapt to each other and work in team, it is not as trivial for robots. In their case, interaction skills typically come at the cost of extensive programming and teaching. Besides, understanding the semantics of a task is necessary to work efficiently and react to changes in the task execution process. As a result, in order to achieve seamless collaboration, appropriate reasoning, learning skills and interaction capabilities are needed. For us humans, a cornerstone of our communication is language that we use to teach, coordinate and communicate. In this paper we thus propose a system allowing (i) to teach new action semantics based on the already available knowledge and (ii) to use natural language communication to resolve ambiguities that could arise while giving commands to the robot. Reasoning then allows new skills to be performed either autonomously or in collaboration with a human. Teaching occurs through a web application and motions are learned with physical demonstration ofthe robotic arm. We demonstrate the utility of our system in two scenarios and reflect upon the challenges that it introduces.",ar,2019-01-01,Paladyn,,2-s2.0-85072921192,,,Article,Angleraud A.,,Tampere University,Tampere,Finland,,,,,1 January 2019,,21100810658,20814836,Journal,10,1,,318-329,1,,,,2,2019,https://doi.org/10.1515/pjbr-2019-0025,,Excluido por no educación

On the result of an unknown modeling error or environment change, the designed gait may be ineffective and an online gait improvement is impossible after the optimization. In this paper, we apply Generalized Path Integral Stochastic Optimal Control to closed-loop model of planar biped robots with point-feet which leads to an online Reinforcement Learning algorithm to design the walking gait. We study the ability of the proposed method to adapt the controller of RABBIT, which is a planar biped robot with point-feet, for stable walking.

For such incremental improvement, here we propose an incremental learning framework based on Q-learning and the adaptive kernel linear (AKL) model. The AKL model is used for storing behavioral policies that are learned by Q-learning. Both the structure and parameters of the AKL model can be trained using a novel L2-norm kernel recursive least squares (L2-KRLS) algorithm. AKL model initially without nodes and gradually accumulates content. The proposed framework allows to learn new behaviors without forgetting the previous ones. A novel local -greedy policy is proposed to speed the convergence rate of Q-learning. It calculates the exploration probability of each state for generating and selecting more important training samples. The performance of our incremental learning framework was validated in two experiments. A curve fitting example shows that the L2-KRLS based AKL model is suitable for incremental learning. The second experiment is based on robot learning tasks. The results show that our framework can incrementally learn behaviors in varying environments.

Different from the traditional sparse reward function, this paper presents two brand-new dense reward functions. First, the azimuth reward function is proposed to accelerate the learning process locally with a more reasonable trajectory by modeling the position and orientation constraints, which can reduce the blindness of exploration dramatically. To further improve the efficiency, a reward function at subtask-level is proposed to provide global guidance for the agent in the DRL. The subtask-level reward function is designed under the assumption that the task can be divided into several subtasks, which reduces the invalid exploration greatly. The extensive experiments show that the proposed reward functions are able to improve the convergence rate by up to three times with the state-of-the-art DRL methods.

These characteristics will seriously affect the accurate extraction of weld seam. To realize the automatic path planning of welding robots, a new method of automatic extraction and identification of narrow butt joint under weak contrast is realized to serve the 3D path teaching of welding robots. To achieve accurate extraction of narrow butt joint under weak contrast, this paper designs a new seam extraction operator to achieve accurate and fast extraction of weld seam with various shapes and sizes.

NO,10.1007/s10514-018-9725-6,Robot learning of industrial assembly task via human demonstrations,"Human–robot collaboration in industrial applications is a challenging robotic task. Human working together with the robot at a workplace to complete a task may create unpredicted events for the robot, as humans can act unpredictably. Humans tend to perform a task in a not fully repetitive manner using their expertise and cognitive capabilities. The traditional robot programming cannot cope with these challenges of human–robot collaboration. In this paper, a framework for robot learning by multiple human demonstrations is introduced. Through the demonstrations, the robot learns the sequence of actions for an assembly task (high-level learning) without the need of pre-programming. Additionally, the robot learns every path as needed for object manipulation (low-level learning). Once the robot has the knowledge of the demonstrated task, it can perform the task in collaboration with the human. However, the need for adaptation of the learned knowledge may arise as the human collaborator could introduce changes in the environment, such as placing an object to be manipulated in a position and orientation different from the demonstrated ones. In this paper, a novel real-time adaptation algorithm to cope with these changes in the environment, introduced by the human factor, is proposed. The proposed algorithm is able to identify the sequence of actions needed to be performed in a new environment. A Gaussian Mixture Model-based modification algorithm is able to adapt the learned path in order to enable robot to successfully complete the task without the need of additional training by demonstration. The proposed framework copes with changes in the position and orientation of the objects to be manipulated and also provides obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the framework enables the human collaborator to suggest different sequence of actions for the learned task, which will be performed by the robot. The proposed algorithm was tested on a dual-arm industrial robot in an assembly scenario and the results are presented.

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2018.11.005,Bio-inspired on-line path planner for cooperative exploration of unknown environment by a Multi-Robot System,"Highlights

•

A cooperative and distributed autonomous navigation system to multi-robot is developed.

•

Path planning and motion control are implemented in an independent and distributed way.

•

Cooperation and autonomy are achieved by sensing, information sharing and pheromone detection.

•

Previous knowledge is unnecessary for navigation: only end robots’ positions are known.

•

Sensing and communication are limited, as occur for real peripheral devices of robots.
This paper aims to present a cooperative and distributed navigation strategy, that is an on-line path planner, for an autonomous multi-robot system. The robots are intended to navigate and explore an unknown environment in order to find and reach obligatory passage points or way-points (goals), and then achieve a known final position. All robots in the team are homogeneous, independent and have limited communication skills. However they interact among them and with the environment to autonomously decide about their paths and tasks: if they should explore the environment, or avoid visiting a previously explored region, or to reach a discovered goal. Information sharing is directly carried out when the robots are into a communication area and/or indirectly by stigmergy. In this case, artificial pheromone, as a repulsive field, is used to mark regions that have already been explored by other members of the team, therefore avoiding redundant exploration and time waste. Fuzzy controllers are used for robots’ motion. The proposed on line path planner performance is evaluated in different simulated environment scenarios and the main results are presented.",ar,2019-02-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,,2-s2.0-85056807191,S0921889018303567,,Article,de Almeida J.P.L.S.,,Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná;Federal Institute of Paraná (IFPR),Curitiba;Colombo,Brazil;Brazil,,,,,February 2019,9218890,18079,,Journal,112,,,32-48,0,,,,22,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889018303567?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1142/S0219843619500026,Vision-based 3D modeling of unknown dynamic environments for real-time humanoid navigation,"In order to achieve real autonomy, robots have to be able to navigate in completely unknown environments. Due to the complexity of computer vision algorithms, almost every approach for robotic navigation is either based on previous knowledge of the environment, such as markers or as resulting from learning methods, or makes strong simplifying assumptions about it (height-map representations, static scenarios). While showing impressive success in certain applications, these approaches limit the potential of legged robots to achieve the amazing flexibility of humans in more complex environments. In this work, we present a strategy for full 3D vision processing that is able to handle changing, dynamic environments. These are modeled using 3D geometries that are processed in real-time by the motion planner of our biped robot Lola for avoiding moving obstacles and walking over platforms. In order to allow for a more intuitive development of such systems in the future, we present tools for visualization including two mixed reality applications using both an external camera and Microsoft’s HoloLens.

NO,10.1109/TRO.2018.2875388,Robot-Robot Gesturing for Anchoring Representations,"In a multirobot system, using shared symbols for objects in the environment is a prerequisite for collaboration. Sharing symbols requires that each agent has anchored a symbol with an internal, sensor level representation, as well as that these symbols match between the agents. The problem can be solved easily when the internal representations can be communicated between the agents. However, with heterogeneous embodiments the available sensors are likely to differ, making it impossible to share the internal representations directly. We propose the use of pointing gestures to align symbols between a heterogeneous group of robots. We describe a planning framework that minimizes the required effort for anchoring representations across robots. The framework allows planning for both the gesturing and observing agents in a decentralized fashion. It considers both implicit sources of failure, such as ambiguous pointing, as well as costs required by actions. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the resulting planning problem has a complex solution structure with multiple local minima.

NO,10.1007/s11042-018-6634-9,Brain programming as a new strategy to create visual routines for object tracking: Towards automation of video tracking design,"This work describes the use of brain programming for automating the video tracking design process. The challenge is that of creating visual programs that learn to detect a toy dinosaur from a database while tested in a visual-tracking scenario. When planning an object tracking system, two sub-tasks need to be approached: detection of moving objects in each frame and correct association of detection to the same object over time. Visual attention is a skill performed by the brain whose functionality is to perceive salient visual features. The automatic design of visual attention programs through an optimization paradigm is applied to the detection-based tracking of objects in a video from a moving camera. A system based on the acquisition and integration steps of the natural dorsal stream was engineered to emulate its selectivity and goal-driven behavior useful to the task of tracking objects. This is considered a challenging problem since many difficulties can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, as well as camera motion, models, and parameters. Tracking relies on the quality of the detection process and automatically designing such stage could significantly improve tracking methods. Experimental results confirm the validity of our approach using three different kinds of robotic systems. Moreover, a comparison with the method of regions with convolutional neural networks is provided to illustrate the benefit of the approach.",ar,2019-03-01,Multimedia Tools and Applications,,2-s2.0-85053546868,,,Article,Olague G.,,Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada,Ensenada,Mexico,,,,,1 March 2019,13807501,25627,15737721,Journal,78,5,,5881-5918,0,,,,12,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11042-018-6634-9,,Excluido por nada que ver (brain programming?)
NO,10.1049/trit.2018.1062,Teaching a robot to use electric tools with regrasp planning,"This study presents a straightforward method to teach robots to use tools. Teaching robots is crucial in quickly deploying and reconfiguring robots in next-generation factories. Conventional methods require third-party systems like wearable devices or complicated vision system to capture, analyse, and map human grasps, motion, and tool poses to robots. These systems assume lots of experience from their users. Unlike the conventional methods, this study does not involve learning human motion and skills. Instead, it only learns the object goal poses from the human user whilst employs regrasp planning to generate robot motion. The method is most suitable for a robot to learn the usage of electric tools that can be operated by simply switching on and off. The proposed method is validated using a dual-arm robot with hand-mounted cameras and several tools. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust, feasible, and simple to teach robots. It can find a collision-free and kino-dynamic feasible grasp sequences and motion trajectories when the goal pose is reachable. The method allows the robot to automatically choose placements or handover considering the surrounding environment as intermediate states to change the pose of the tool and use tools following human demonstrations.",ar,2019-03-01,CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology,,2-s2.0-85068359418,,,Article,Raessa M.,,Osaka University,Suita,Japan,,,,,1 March 2019,24686557,21100970248,24682322,Journal,4,1,,54-63,1,,,,4,2019,https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/trit.2018.1062,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.3390/s19051016,Robotic active information gathering for spatial field reconstruction with rapidly-exploring random trees and online learning of gaussian processes,"Information gathering (IG) algorithms aim to intelligently select a mobile sensor actions required to efficiently obtain an accurate reconstruction of a physical process, such as an occupancy map, or a magnetic field. Many recent works have proposed algorithms for IG that employ Gaussian processes (GPs) as underlying model of the process. However, most algorithms discretize the state space, which makes them computationally intractable for robotic systems with complex dynamics. Moreover, they are not suited for online information gathering tasks as they assume prior knowledge about GP parameters. This paper presents a novel approach that tackles the two aforementioned issues. Specifically, our approach includes two intertwined steps: (i) a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) search that allows a robot to identify unvisited locations, and to learn the GP parameters, and (ii) an RRT*-based informative path planning that guides the robot towards those locations by maximizing the information gathered while minimizing path cost. The combination of the two steps allows an online realization of the algorithm, while eliminating the need for discretization. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art both in simulations, and in a lab experiment in which a ground-based robot explores the magnetic field intensity within an indoor environment populated with obstacles.

NO,10.1109/TASE.2018.2840345,Facilitating Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks by Teaching-Learning-Collaboration from Human Demonstrations,"Collaborative robots are widely employed in strict hybrid assembly tasks involved in intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, we develop a teaching-learning-collaboration (TLC) model for the collaborative robot to learn from human demonstrations and assist its human partner in shared working situations. The human could program the robot using natural language instructions according to his/her personal working preferences via this approach. Afterward, the robot learns from human assembly demonstrations by taking advantage of the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm and updates its task-based knowledge using the optimal assembly strategy. In the collaboration process, the robot is able to leverage its learned knowledge to actively assist the human in the collaborative assembly task. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach presents considerable robustness and applicability in human-robot collaborative tasks. Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the human-robot collaborative assembly problem in the context of advanced manufacturing. Collaborative robotics makes a huge shift from the traditional robot-in-a-cage model to robots interacting with people in an open working environment. When the human works with the robot in the shared workspace, it is significant to lessen human programming effort and improve the human-robot collaboration efficiency once the task is updated. We develop a TLC model for the robot to learn from human demonstrations and assist its human partner in collaborative tasks. Once the task is changed, the human may code the robot via natural language instructions according to his/her personal working preferences. The robot can learn from human assembly demonstrations to update its task-based knowledge, which can be leveraged by the robot to actively assist the human to accomplish the collaborative task.

The proposed incremental RL (IRL) algorithm learns from the dynamic environments without making any assumptions or having any prior knowledge about the ever-changing environment. First, IRL generates a detector-agent to detect the changed part of the environment (drift environment) by executing a virtual RL process. Then, the agent gives priority to the drift environment and its neighbor environment for iteratively updating their state-action value functions using new rewards by dynamic programming. After the prioritized sweeping process, IRL restarts a canonical learning process to obtain a new optimal policy adapting to the new environment. The novelty is that IRL fuses the new information into the existing knowledge system incrementally as well as weakening the conflict between them. The IRL algorithm is compared to two direct approaches and various state-of-the-art transfer learning methods for classical maze navigation problems and an intelligent warehouse with multiple robots.

For such tasks, visual feedback is a fundamental asset to provide robots with terrain awareness. However, robust dynamic locomotion on difficult terrains with real-time performance guarantees remains a challenge. We present here a real-time, dynamic foothold adaptation strategy based on visual feedback. Our method adjusts the landing position of the feet in a fully reactive manner, using only on-board computers and sensors. The correction is computed and executed continuously along the swing phase trajectory of each leg. To efficiently adapt the landing position, we implement a self-supervised foothold classifier based on a convolutional neural network. Our method results in an up to 200 times faster computation with respect to the full-blown heuristics. Our goal is to react to visual stimuli from the environment, bridging the gap between blind reactive locomotion and purely vision-based planning strategies.

AutoRL first finds a reward that maximizes task completion and then finds a neural network architecture that maximizes the cumulative of the found reward. Empirical evaluations, both in simulation and on-robot, show that AutoRL policies do not suffer from the catastrophic forgetfulness that plagues many other deep reinforcement learning algorithms, generalize to new environments and moving obstacles, are robust to sensor, actuator, and localization noise, and can serve as robust building blocks for larger navigation tasks.

Imitation learning provides an intuitive way for the end user to specify context of a new robot application without the need of traditional programming skills. On the other hand, constraint-based robot programming allows us to define complex tasks involving different kinds of sensor input. Combination of both enables adaptation of complex tasks to new environments and new objects with a small number of demonstrations. The proposed method uses a statistical uni-modal model to describe the demonstrations in terms of a number of weighted basis functions. This is then combined with model-based descriptions of other aspects of the task at hand. This approach was tested in a use case inspired by an industrial application, in which the required transfer motions were learned from a small number of demonstrations, and gradually improved by adding new demonstrations. Information on a collision-free path was introduced through a small number of demonstrations. The method showed a high level of composability with force and vision controlled tasks.

As non-expert users might have little intuition about how their specification impacts the robot's performance, we design a learning system that interacts with users to find an optimal solution. Using active preference learning, we iteratively show alternative paths that the robot could take on an interface. From the user feedback on ranking the alternatives, we learn about the weights that users place on each part of their specification. We extend the user model from our previous work to a discrete Bayesian learning model and introduce a greedy algorithm for proposing alternative that operates on the notion of equivalence regions of user weights.

Extracting PHT is of paramount importance in several engineering and clinical applications such as assistive and robotic rehabilitation technologies. In such systems, PHT is modeled as the input noise to the system and thus there is a surge of interest in estimation an compensation of the noise. Although various works in the literature have attempted to estimate and extract the PHT, in this letter, first, we argue that the ground truth signal used in existing works to optimize the performance of tremor extraction techniques is not accurate enough, and thus the performance measures for the prior techniques are not perfectly reliable. In addition, most of the existing tremor extraction techniques impose unrealistic assumptions, which are, typically, violated in practical settings. This letter proposes a novel technique that for the first time incorporates deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks as a processing tool for PHT extraction.

The objective of this paper is to present a full-stack, real-time motion planning framework for kinodynamic robots and then show how it is applied and demonstrated on a physical quadrotor system operating in a laboratory environment. The proposed framework utilizes an offline–online computation paradigm, neighborhood classification through machine learning, sampling-based motion planning with an optimal cost distance metric, and trajectory smoothing to achieve real-time planning for aerial vehicles. This framework accounts for dynamic obstacles with an event-based replanning structure and a locally reactive control layer that minimizes replanning events. The approach is demonstrated on a quadrotor navigating moving obstacles in an indoor space and stands as, arguably, one of the first demonstrations of full-online kinodynamic motion planning, with execution cycles of 3 Hz to 5 Hz. For the quadrotor, a simplified dynamics model is used during the planning phase to accelerate online computation.

Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning, has gained increasing popularity in autonomous mobile robot path planning recently, due to its self-learning ability without requiring a priori model of the environment. Yet, despite such advantage, Q-learning exhibits slow convergence to the optimal solution. In order to address this limitation, the concept of partially guided Q-learning is introduced wherein, the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is utilized to improve the initialization of Q-learning. Experimental evaluation of the proposed improved Q-learning under the challenging environment with a different layout of obstacles shows that the convergence of Q-learning can be accelerated when Q-values are initialized appropriately using the FPA.

Training SVMs for large datasets is an extremely challenging task due to excessive storage and computational requirements. To tackle so-called big data problems, one needs to design scalable distributed algorithms to parallelize the model training and to develop efficient implementations of these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for SVM training that is scalable and communication-efficient. The algorithm uses a compact representation of the kernel matrix, which is based on the QR decomposition of low-rank approximations, to reduce both computation and storage requirements for the training stage. This is accompanied by considerable reduction in communication required for a distributed implementation of the algorithm. Experiments on benchmark data sets with up to five million samples demonstrate negligible communication overhead and scalability on up to 64 cores. Execution times are vast improvements over other widely used packages.

Reactive robot navigation in such goal-directed phonotaxis tasks requires generating smooth motion paths towards the acoustic target while simultaneously avoiding obstacles. We have reported earlier on a neural circuit for acoustic navigation which learned stable robot motion paths for a simulated mobile robot. However, in complex environments, the learned motion paths were not smooth. Here, we extend our earlier architecture, by adding a path-smoothing behaviour, to generate smooth motion paths for a simulated mobile robot. This allows the robot to learn to smoothly navigate towards a virtual sound source while avoiding randomly placed obstacles in the environment. We demonstrate through five independent learning trials in simulation that the proposed extension learns motion paths that are not only smooth but also relatively shorter as compared to those generated without learning as well as by our earlier architecture.",ar,2019-06-01,Neural Computing and Applications,,2-s2.0-85056302210,,,Article,Shaikh D.,,Syddansk Universitet,Odense,Denmark,,,,,1 June 2019,9410643,24800,,Journal,31,6,,1765-1781,0,,,,2,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00521-018-3845-y,,Excluido por no educación

The proposed model, enhanced episodic memory adaptive resonance theory (EEM-ART), categorizes and encodes experiences of a robot to the environment and generates a cognitive map. EEM-ART consists of multilayer ART networks to extract novel events and encode spatio-temporal connection as episodes by incrementally generating cognitive neurons. The model connects episodes to construct a sensorimotor map for the robot to continuously perform path planning and goal navigation. Experimental results for a mobile robot indicate that EEM-ART can process multiple sensory sources for learning events and encoding episodes simultaneously.

Experimental evaluation with a real robot.
As autonomous service robots become more affordable and thus available for the general public, there is a growing need for user-friendly interfaces to control these systems. Control interfaces typically get more complicated with increasing complexity of robotic tasks and environments. Traditional control modalities such as touch, speech or gesture are not necessarily suited for all users. While some users can make the effort to familiarize themselves with a robotic system, users with motor disabilities may not be capable of controlling such systems even though they need robotic assistance most. In this paper, we present a novel framework that allows these users to interact with a robotic service assistant in a closed-loop fashion, using only thoughts. The system is composed of several interacting components: a brain–computer interface (BCI) that uses non-invasive neuronal signal recording and co-adaptive deep learning, high-level task planning based on referring expressions, navigation and manipulation planning as well as environmental perception. We extensively evaluate the BCI in various tasks, determine the performance of the goal formulation user interface and investigate its intuitiveness in a user study. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the system in real-world scenarios, considering fetch-and-carry tasks, close human–robot interactions and in presence of unexpected changes. As our results show, the system is capable of adapting to frequent changes in the environment and reliably accomplishes given tasks within a reasonable amount of time. Combined with high-level task planning based on referring expressions and an autonomous robotic system, interesting new perspectives open up for non-invasive BCI-based human–robot interactions.",ar,2019-06-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,,2-s2.0-85063740287,S0921889018302227,,Article,Kuhner D.,,Universität Freiburg,Freiburg im Breisgau,Germany,,,,,June 2019,9218890,18079,,Journal,116,,,98-113,1,,,,17,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889018302227?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por machine learning

Companies are encouraged to integrate new tools in their production processes in order to improve working conditions and increase productivity and production quality. The integration between information, communication technologies and industrial automation can create highly flexible production models for products and services that can be customized through real-time interactions between consumer, production and machinery throughout the production process. The future of production, therefore, depends on increasingly intelligent machinery through the use of digital systems. The key elements for future integrated devices are intelligent systems and machines, based on human–machine interaction and information sharing. To do so, the implementation of shared languages that allow different systems to dialogue in a simple way is necessary. In this perspective, the use of advanced prototyping tools like Open-Source programming systems, the development of more detailed multibody models through the use of CAD software and the use of self-learning techniques will allow for developing a new class of machines capable of revolutionizing our companies.

NO,10.1108/EL-10-2018-0213,A Chinese ancient book digital humanities research platform to support digital humanities research,"Purpose

With the rapid development of digital humanities, some digital humanities platforms have been successfully developed to support digital humanities research for humanists. However, most of them have still not provided a friendly digital reading environment and practicable social network analysis tool to support humanists on interpreting texts and exploring characters’ social network relationships. Moreover, the advancement of digitization technologies for the retrieval and use of Chinese ancient books is arising an unprecedented challenge and opportunity. For these reasons, this paper aims to present a Chinese ancient books digital humanities research platform (CABDHRP) to support historical China studies. In addition to providing digital archives, digital reading, basic search and advanced search functions for Chinese ancient books, this platform still provides two novel functions that can more effectively support digital humanities research, including an automatic text annotation system (ATAS) for interpreting texts and a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) for exploring characters’ social network relationships.

Design/methodology/approach

This study adopted DSpace, an open-source institutional repository system, to serve as a digital archives system for archiving scanned images, metadata, and full texts to develop the CABDHRP for supporting digital humanities (DH) research. Moreover, the ATAS developed in the CABDHRP used the Node.js framework to implement the system’s front- and back-end services, as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by different databases, such as China Biographical Database (CBDB) and TGAZ, used to retrieve the useful linked data (LD) sources for interpreting ancient texts. Also, Neo4j which is an open-source graph database management system was used to implement the CSNRMT of the CABDHRP. Finally, JavaScript and jQuery were applied to develop a monitoring program embedded in the CABDHRP to record the use processes from humanists based on xAPI (experience API). To understand the research participants’ perception when interpreting the historical texts and characters’ social network relationships with the support of ATAS and CSNRMT, semi-structured interviews with 21 research participants were conducted.

Findings

An ATAS embedded in the reading interface of CABDHRP can collect resources from different databases through LD for automatically annotating ancient texts to support digital humanities research. It allows the humanists to refer to resources from diverse databases when interpreting ancient texts, as well as provides a friendly text annotation reader for humanists to interpret ancient text through reading. Additionally, the CSNRMT provided by the CABDHRP can semi-automatically identify characters’ names based on Chinese word segmentation technology and humanists’ support to confirm and analyze characters’ social network relationships from Chinese ancient books based on visualizing characters’ social networks as a knowledge graph. The CABDHRP not only can stimulate humanists to explore new viewpoints in a humanistic research, but also can promote the public to emerge the learning interest and awareness of Chinese ancient books.

Originality/value

This study proposed a novel CABDHRP that provides the advanced features, including the automatic word segmentation of Chinese text, automatic Chinese text annotation, semi-automatic character social network analysis and user behavior analysis, that are different from other existed digital humanities platforms. Currently, there is no this kind of digital humanities platform developed for humanists to support digital humanities research.",ar,2019-06-03,Electronic Library,,2-s2.0-85067009122,,,Article,Chen C.M.,,National Chengchi University,Taipei,Taiwan,,,,,3 Jun 2019,2640473,15420,,Journal,37,2,,314-336,0,,,,2,2019,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EL-10-2018-0213/full/html,,Excluido por nada que ver
SI,10.1108/ILS-05-2018-0035,Teachers’ goals predict computational thinking gainsin robotics,"Purpose

Computational thinking (CT) is widely considered to be an important component of teaching generalizable computer science skills to all students in a range of learning environments, including robotics. However, despite advances in the design of robotics curricula that can teach CT, actual enactment in classrooms may often fail to reach this target. This study aims to understand whether the various instructional goals teachers’ hold when using these curricula may offer one potential explanation for disparities in outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach

In this study, the authors examine results from N = 206 middle-school students’ pre- and post-tests of CT, attitudinal surveys and surveys of their teacher’s instructional goals to determine if student attitudes and learning gains in CT are related to the instructional goals their teachers endorsed while implementing a shared robotics programming curriculum.

Findings

The findings provide evidence that despite using the same curriculum, students showed differential learning gains on the CT assessment when in classrooms with teachers who rated CT as a more important instructional goal; these effects were particularly strong for women. Students in classroom with teachers who rated CT more highly also showed greater maintenance of positive attitudes toward programming.

Originality/value

While there is a growing body of literature regarding curricular interventions that provide CT learning opportunities, this study provides a critical insight into the role that teachers may play as a potential support or barrier to the success of these curricula.

Unfortunately, in complex environments, robots are bound to encounter situations in which their models do not accurately represent the world. Furthermore, these context-dependent model inaccuracies may be subtle, such that multiple observations may be necessary to distinguish them from noise. This paper formalizes the problem of detection and correction of such subtle contextual model inaccuracies in autonomous robots, and presents an algorithm to address this problem. The solution relies on reasoning about these contextual inaccuracies as parametric regions of inaccurate modeling (RIMs) in the robot’s planning space.

We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces.

Solutions consider interactions on a motion planning level to determine the feasibility and cost of the multi-robot team solution. Modeling these problems with current integrated task and motion planning (TMP) approaches typically requires reasoning about the possible interactions and checking many of the possible robot combinations when searching for a solution. We present a multi-robot planning method called Interaction Templates (ITs), which moves certain types of robot interactions from the task planner to the motion planner. ITs model interactions between a set of robots with a small roadmap. This roadmap is then tiled into the environment and connected to the robots’ individual roadmaps. The resulting combined roadmap allows interactions to be considered by the motion planner. We apply ITs to homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams under both required and optional cooperation scenarios, which previously required a task planning method.

It puts emphasis on the idea of using distributed architecture to plan the trajectories of a group of wheeled mobile robots. Each robot must be able to detect and avoid collision with both static and dynamic obstacles present in its environment/neighborhood. This study seeks to improve the artificial potential field (APF) method in order to have good trajectory planning of a multi-robot system. In order to address the purpose of this work, we employed the hybrid approach, which is a combination of three techniques: the APF method; the neighborhood system; and the notion of priority between the robots. Moreover, the minimum local problem is handled in this paper using the non-minimum speed algorithm. The implemented approach is adapted to solve the trajectory planning problem for a multi-robot system. So, the problem of intersection of robots at the same passage point is solved through using the method of assignment of priority between robots. We also used the neighborhood detection technique to reduce the influence area of each robot and to optimize the time of calculation.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2019.2901898,Robot Motion Planning in Learned Latent Spaces,"This letter presents latent sampling-based motion planning (L-SBMP), a methodology toward computing motion plans for complex robotic systems by learning a plannable latent representation. Recent works in control of robotic systems have effectively leveraged local, low-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional dynamics. In this letter, we combine these recent advances with techniques from sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) in order to design a methodology capable of planning for high-dimensional robotic systems beyond the reach of traditional approaches (e.g., humanoids, or even systems where planning occurs in the visual space). Specifically, the learned latent space is constructed through an autoencoding network, a dynamics network, and a collision checking network, which mirror the three main algorithmic primitives of SBMP, namely state sampling, local steering, and collision checking. Notably, these networks can be trained through only raw data of the system's states and actions along with a supervising collision checker. Building upon these networks, an RRT-based algorithm is used to plan motions directly in the latent space-we refer to this exploration algorithm as learned latent RRT. This algorithm globally explores the latent space and is capable of generalizing to new environments. The overall methodology is demonstrated on two planning problems, namely a visual planning problem, whereby planning happens in the visual (pixel) space, and a humanoid robot planning problem.",ar,2019-07-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,,2-s2.0-85064006237,,,Article,Ichter B.,,Google LLC,Mountain View,United States,,,,,July 2019,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,4,3,8653875,2407-2414,1,,,,27,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8653875,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1109/LRA.2019.2903261,PRIMAL: Pathfinding via Reinforcement and Imitation Multi-Agent Learning,"Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is an essential component of many large-scale, real-world robot deployments, from aerial swarms to warehouse automation. However, despite the community's continued efforts, most state-of-the-art MAPF planners still rely on centralized planning and scale poorly past a few hundred agents. Such planning approaches are maladapted to realworld deployments, where noise and uncertainty often require paths be recomputed online, which is impossible when planning times are in seconds to minutes. We present PRIMAL, a novel framework for MAPF that combines reinforcement and imitation learning to teach fully decentralized policies, where agents reactively plan paths online in a partially observable world while exhibiting implicit coordination. This framework extends our previous work on distributed learning of collaborative policies by introducing demonstrations of an expert MAPF planner during training, as well as careful reward shaping and environment sampling. Once learned, the resulting policy can be copied onto any number of agents and naturally scales to different team sizes and world dimensions. We present results on randomized worlds with up to 1024 agents and compare success rates against state-of-the-art MAPF planners.

A novel multi-stage cost learning method is presented.

•

•

Achieve better segmentation accuracy than two nonparametric segmentation method.

•

Generate trajectories that maintain properties of each substage in new environment.
Learning from demonstration provides an effective method to resolve the problem of teaching robot to execute complex motions without expert knowledge about the robot system. In this paper, we present a novel learning from demonstration method based on multi-stage cost learning. The recorded demonstrations are assumed to be composed of several substages chained together. Leveraging this assumption, a segmentation and cost learning framework is proposed to search for the cutting points that divide the unsegmented demonstrations into multiple substages and retrieve cost function for each substage. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first solution to learn multi-stage cost functions in continuous domain without restricting the possible cost functions into limited numbers or simple forms. To generate new trajectory, a complete objective functional is constructed based on the learned multi-stage cost functions plus other constraints like obstacle avoidance and is optimized with functional gradient method. The generated trajectory can adapt to new environments while maintain the specific properties of each substage as demonstrations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation study and experiments conducted on a real robot manipulator.",ar,2019-07-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,,2-s2.0-85064654584,S0921889018303075,,Article,Hu J.,,State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology,Hangzhou,China,,,,,July 2019,9218890,18079,,Journal,117,,,57-67,0,,,,2,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889018303075?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1109/LRA.2019.2898714,Specifying dual-arm robot planning problems through natural language and demonstration,"Multi-modal robot programming with natural language and demonstration is a promising technique for efficient teaching of manipulation tasks in industrial environments. In particular, with modern dual-arm robots designed to quickly take over tasks at typical industrial workbenches, the direct teaching of task sequences hardly utilizes the robots' capabilities. We therefore propose a two-staged approach that combines natural language instructions and demonstration with simultaneous task allocation and motion scheduling based on constraint programming. Instead of providing a task description and demonstrations that are replayed to a large extent, the user describes tasks to be scheduled with all relevant constraints and demonstrates relevant locations relative to workpieces and other objects. With explicitly stated constraints on the partial ordering of tasks, the solver allocates the tasks to the robot arms and schedules them in time while avoiding self-collisions and reducing the makespan in our experiment by 33%. The linguistic concepts of naming and grouping enable systematic reuse of sub-task ensembles. The proposed approach is evaluated with four variants of a gluing use-case from furniture assembly in user studies with ten participants. In these user studies, we observed a speed-up for the task definition of more than six times compared to a textual specification of the planning problems using the Python-based planner API.",ar,2019-07-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,,2-s2.0-85065464850,,,Article,Behrens J.K.,,Robert Bosch GmbH,Gerlingen,Germany,,,,,July 2019,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,4,3,8638957,2622-2629,0,,,,4,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8638957,,Excluido por no educación

In this situation, the worker's safety and work-time efficiency must be enhanced simultaneously. In this paper, we extend a task scheduling system proposed in the previous work by installing an online trajectory generation system. On the basis of the probabilistic prediction of the worker's motion and the receding horizon scheme for the trajectory planning, the proposed motion planning system calculates an optimal trajectory that realizes collision avoidance and the reduction of waste time simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed system plans the robot's trajectory adaptively based on updated predictions and its uncertainty to deal not only with the regular behavior of workers but also with their irregular behavior.

To build such a system, we developed an interactive tutoring framework, named “Holert”, which can translate task descriptions in natural language to machine-interpretable logical forms automatically. Compared to previous works, Holert allows users to teach the robot by further explaining their intentions in an interactive tutor mode. Furthermore, Holert introduces a semantic dependency model to enable the robot to “understand” similar task descriptions. We have deployed Holert on an open-source robot platform, Turtlebot 2.

Our approach is based on a Markov decision process model of the robot in its environment, encompassing a topological map where nodes represent relevant locations in the environment, and a range of tasks that can be executed in different locations. The navigation in the topological map is modeled stochastically for a specific time of day. This is done by using spatio-temporal models that provide, for a given time of day, the probability of successfully navigating between two topological nodes, and the expected time to do so. We then present a methodology to generate cost optimal policies for tasks specified in co-safe linear temporal logic. Our key contribution is to address scenarios in which the task may not be achievable with probability one. We introduce a task progression function and present an approach to generate policies that are formally guaranteed to, in decreasing order of priority: maximize the probability of finishing the task; maximize progress towards completion, if this is not possible; and minimize the expected time or cost required.

•

The main contribution of our paper is a focused discussion on what a knowledge representation is as it pertains to the robotics field: a comprehensive tool that encompasses high-level knowledge and low-level features.

•

This paper aims to define and discuss knowledge representation for robots, to review the literature for existing solutions, and to identify possible issues in the creation of an effective representation. We also review several tools and/or models that have been successfully applied to smaller sub-problems in robot learning and manipulation, which can be used as components to knowledge representations.

•

We discuss key characteristics of representations that allow them to function, in spite of the highly variable nature of a robot’s working environment and the objects found within it. We also propose specific requirements that are necessary to build the ideal knowledge representation, drawing on concepts discussed in previous works.
Within the realm of service robotics, researchers have placed a great amount of effort into learning, understanding, and representing motions as manipulations for task execution by robots. The task of robot learning and problem-solving is very broad, as it integrates a variety of tasks such as object detection, activity recognition, task/motion planning, localization, knowledge representation and retrieval, and the intertwining of perception/vision and machine learning techniques. In this paper, we solely focus on knowledge representations and notably how knowledge is typically gathered, represented, and reproduced to solve problems as done by researchers in the past decades. In accordance with the definition of knowledge representations, we discuss the key distinction between such representations and useful learning models that have extensively been introduced and studied in recent years, such as machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic modeling, and semantic graphical structures. Along with an overview of such tools, we discuss the problems which have existed in robot learning and how they have been built and used as solutions, technologies or developments (if any) which have contributed to solving them.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the ability of high-functioning autistic (HFA) children to programme robotic behaviour and sought to elucidate how they describe and construct a robot’s behaviour using iconic programming software.

Design/methodology/approach

The robotic learning environment is based on the iPad, an iconic programming app (KinderBot), and EV3. Two case studies, of A. and N., both HFA children of average age 10.5, are the focus of this research.

Findings

The research revealed how the participants succeeded in programming the behaviour of an “other” at different programming complexity levels (from simple action to combinations of states of two binary sensors and rule with subroutine). A transformation from procedural to declarative description was also found.

Practical implications

This research on the ability of HFA children to programme robotic behaviour yielded results that can be implemented in K-12 education. Furthermore, learning to programme robots and understand how robotic technologies work may help HFA children to better understand other technology in their environment.

Originality/value

In this research, the authors present an innovative approach that for the first time enables HFA children to “design” the behaviour of smart artefacts to use their sensors to adapt in accordance with the environment. For most HFA children, this would be the first opportunity to “design” the behaviour of the other, as opposed to oneself, since in most of their experience they have been largely controlled by another person.",ar,2019-08-19,Journal of Enabling Technologies,,2-s2.0-85070370844,,,Article,Lahav O.,,Tel Aviv University,Tel Aviv-Yafo,Israel,,,,,19 Aug 2019,,21100818512,23986263,Journal,13,2,,82-91,0,,,,0,2019,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JET-12-2018-0069/full/html,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RNtH40gI-yzY0hpropKPw701oiZV0sJP/view?usp=sharing,"Enfocado en los efectos de la programación de robots en chicos con autismo (interesante, capaz sirve para complementar la sección ""Importancia del tema"" en la intro de la tesis)"

The path of the robot contains an unknown number of both static and moving obstacles that get in its way. To simulate the use of real sensors, the implementation uses only local information available within a predeﬁned radius for decision- making. To address this problem, feature ranking is introduced, where the top k obstacles are taken into consideration in planning the robot path. Feature ranking is applied to linear regression and neural networks to compare their generalization ability against a baseline policy. During the development of the system, the robot undergoes a learning phase, where the moving obstacles move at 50% of the robot’s speed.

•

•

Task swapping between robots can results in negative effects.

•

Allocation of tasks and ensuring collision free trajectories is computationally hard.

•

A novel measure for ordering temporally constrained tasks performs good.

•

Extensive simulation showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
Multi-robot systems (MRS) are a reference solution for many prominent real-world applications, e.g. management of warehouses or exploration of unknown environments. One of the most fundamental computational problems in MRS is that of planning the assignment of tasks to robots when such tasks have deadlines, i.e. constraints on when the execution must take place.

The problem, when multiple objective functions of interest need to be optimized, is both NP-Hard and hard to approximate, and few heuristics are known in the literature to handle it. Unfortunately, none of them guarantees that the trajectories used by the robots when moving between tasks’ locations are collision-free at planning time. Rather, they implement a reactive behavior, i.e. they abort the execution of a planned task whenever something goes wrong, e.g. trajectories of robots intersect or a deadline is missed due to some obstacle. This approach induces negative effects on the global performance of the system in the form of waste of energy, due to high distances traveled by the fleet members, or in the form of high convergence time to execute tasks. Therefore, planning the assignments of temporally constrained tasks with the guarantee of avoiding collisions can be a desirable feature for multi-robot systems.

In this paper, we present CFAT-D (Collision-Free Allocation of Tasks having Deadlines), a new algorithm that can allocate temporally constrained tasks while guaranteeing that used trajectories are collision-free at planning time. We prove CFAT-D to be correct and showcase its effectiveness through an extensive experimental evaluation. Finally, we provide a roadmap toward the practical implementation of the new strategy in real-world environments.",ar,2019-09-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,,2-s2.0-85068934415,S0921889018306493,,Article,D'Emidio M.,,Università degli Studi dell'Aquila,L'Aquila,Italy,,,,,September 2019,9218890,18079,,Journal,119,,,151-172,0,,,,6,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889018306493?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1109/TCDS.2018.2841002,Automatic Object Searching and Behavior Learning for Mobile Robots in Unstructured Environment by Deep Belief Networks,"Automatic object searching is one of the essential skills for domestic robots to operate in unstructured human environments. It involves concatenation of several capabilities, including object identification, obstacle avoidance, path planning, and navigation. In this paper, we propose an automatic object searching framework for a mobile robot equipped with a single RGB-D camera. The obstacle avoidance is achieved by a behavior learning algorithm based on deep belief networks. The target object is recognized using scale-invariant feature transform descriptors and the relative position between the target and mobile robot is estimated from the RGB-D data. Subsequently, the mobile robot makes a path planning to the target location using an improved bug-based algorithm.

System optimization is particularly laborious as the pertinent design space includes various conflicting objectives and a swarm of free parameters. Automating parameter optimization can enhance system quality while ensuring low design cost and high performance. In this tutorial, we review several recent optimization tools for selecting design parameters and architecture. These tools include heuristic methods, reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary strategies. We elaborate on the basics of each algorithm and explain the benefits and tradeoffs when each is applied to system design. To demonstrate how these methods can be applied, we review several real world examples: analog circuit design, neural network compression, and the design of domain -specific accelerators.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2019.2925731,Deep visual mpc-policy learning for navigation,"Humans can routinely follow a trajectory defined by a list of images/landmarks. However, traditional robot navigation methods require accurate mapping of the environment, localization, and planning. Moreover, these methods are sensitive to subtle changes in the environment. In this letter, we propose PoliNet, a deep visual model predictive control-policy learning method that can perform visual navigation while avoiding collisions with unseen objects on the navigation path. PoliNet takes in as input a visual trajectory and 360° images from robot's current view and outputs velocity commands fora planning horizon of N steps that optimally balance between trajectory following and obstacle avoidance. PoliNet is trained using a differentiable neural image predictive model and a traversability estimation model in an model predictive control setup, with minimal human supervision. PoliNet can be applied to visual trajectory in new scenes without retraining. We show experimentally that the robot can follow a visual trajectory even if it does not start from the exact same position and in the presence of previously unseen obstacles. We validated our algorithm with tests both in a realistic simulation environment and in the real world outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under similar conditions in success rate, coverage rate of the trajectory, and with lower computational load.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2019.2931199,RL-RRT: Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Learning Reachability Estimators from RL Policies,"This letter addresses two challenges facing samplingbased kinodynamic motion planning: a way to identify good candidate states for local transitions and the subsequent computationally intractable steering between these candidate states. Through the combination of sampling-based planning, a Rapidly Exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) and an efficient kinodynamic motion planner through machine learning, we propose an efficient solution to long-range planning for kinodynamic motion planning. First, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn an obstacle-avoiding policy that maps a robot's sensor observations to actions, which is used as a local planner during planning and as a controller during execution. Second, we train a reachability estimator in a supervised manner, which predicts the RL policy's time to reach a state in the presence of obstacles. Lastly, we introduce RL-RRT that uses the RL policy as a local planner, and the reachability estimator as the distance function to bias tree-growth towards promising regions. We evaluate our method on three kinodynamic systems, including physical robot experiments. Results across all three robots tested indicate that RL-RRT outperforms state of the art kinodynamic planners in efficiency, and also provides a shorter path finish time than a steering function free method. The learned local planner policy and accompanying reachability estimator demonstrate transferability to the previously unseen experimental environments, making RL-RRT fast because the expensive computations are replaced with simple neural network inference.",ar,2019-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,,2-s2.0-85071442524,,,Article,Chiang H.T.L.,,The University of New Mexico;Google LLC,Albuquerque;Mountain View,United States;United States,,,,,October 2019,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,4,4,8772207,4298-4305,0,,,,17,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8772207,,Excluido por machine learning

The purpose of this paper is to present design and performance evaluation through simulation of a parking management system (PMS) for a fully automated, multi-story, puzzle-type and robotic parking structure with the overall objective of minimizing customer wait times while maximizing the space utilization.

Design/methodology/approach

The presentation entails development and integration of a complete suite of path planning, elevator scheduling and resource allocation algorithms. The PMS aims to manage multiple concurrent requests, in real time and in a dynamic context, for storage and retrieval of vehicles loaded onto robotic carts for a fully automated, multi-story and driving-free parking structure. The algorithm suite employs the incremental informed search algorithm D* Lite with domain-specific heuristics and the uninformed search algorithm Uniform Cost Search for path search and planning. An optimization methodology based on nested partitions and Genetic algorithm is adapted for scheduling of a group of elevators. The study considered a typical business day scenario in the center of a metropolis.

Findings

The simulation study indicates that the proposed design for the PMS is able to serve concurrent storage-retrieval requests representing a wide range of Poisson distributed customer arrival rates in real time while requiring reasonable computing resources under realistic scenarios. The customer waiting times for both storage and retrieval requests are within acceptable bounds, which are set as no more than 5 min, even in the presence of up to 100 concurrent storage and retrieval requests. The design is able to accommodate a variety of customer arrival rates and presence of immobilized vehicles which are assumed to be scattered across the floors of the structure to make it possible for deployment in real-time environments.

These new kinds of automation systems allow more product variations, smaller life cycles, smaller batch sizes and pave the way from mass production to mass customization. This is due to completely new breed of safe robot technology but also novel ways of setting up new applications like e.g. kinesthetic programming. However, the topic of reducing the programming effort for complex tasks using natural modes of communication is still open. This paper addresses the key developments in this field, shows different ways of programming, and gives relevant use cases in industrial assembly. The technology coverage starts with an online workflow editor called XROB that allows easy-to-use setup of process workflows and related skill parameters. However, in order to reduce the programming effort, a novel way to demonstrate process trajectories by using instrumented hand guided process tools is presented. Finally, the paper gives an overview of a promising approach that allows programming without touching the robot just by demonstrating the process by an expert. The semantic relations between activities executed by the human and robot skills are captured to learn the task sequence of the assembly process. The acquired process knowledge is refined to execute robotic tasks with the help of an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).

This method uses evolutionary operators to create and test numerical splits and subsets of categorical values in accordance with a fitness function.

The torch is manipulated by the user in a virtual environment applying a haptic interface. An approach based on a spring-damper model is proposed to compute the force to be felt by the user during the manipulation of the interface. The force is such that more realistic sensations are perceived by the hand’s user if a collision occurs of the torch in the virtual environment. A suitable strategy is employed to represent the virtual torch by two coupled models with spring-damper systems (SDS). Such models are termed kinematic virtual torch (KVT) and dynamic virtual torch (DVT). Thus, in the studied system, the DVT follows the geometric coordinates of the KVT during a manipulation of the torch avoiding penetration of other objects in the scene. Careful analyses are accomplished on manipulation tasks using different SDS configurations in a case study in order to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Recently, CALPHAD-based tools have been used to generate isothermal phase diagrams that are in turn utilized to plan gradient paths that avoid these phases. However, existing frameworks rely extensively on the (limited) ability of humans to visualize and navigate high-dimensional spaces. To tackle this challenge, a Machine Learning approach was used here to map out undesirable regions as ‘obstacles’, while a path-planning algorithm, commonly used in robotics community, was utilized to identify a path in a composition space that would avoid the obstacles, while simultaneously minimizing a cost function. This framework was validated by designing and 3-D printing a functional gradient in bulk samples from 316L stainless steel to pure chromium with a multi-material direct laser deposition system. Both the planned gradient and simple linear gradient samples were fabricated and characterized in as-deposited and heat-treated states to determine local compositions, microstructure and phase constituents. The planned gradient resulted in complete elimination of the detrimental σ phase after heat treatment, demonstrating the success of the methodology.

NO,10.1016/j.jss.2019.110406,DEEPLINK: Recovering issue-commit links based on deep learning,"Highlights

•

Only 42.2% of issues in 1078 GitHub Java projects are linked to commits.

•

Biased data can cause an effective degradation of link recovery approaches.

•

DeepLink outperformed a link recovery approach by 4.6% in F-measure.
The links between issues in an issue-tracking system and commits resolving the issues in a version control system are important for a variety of software engineering tasks (e.g., bug prediction, bug localization and feature location). However, only a small portion of such links are established by manually including issue identifiers in commit logs, leaving a large portion of them lost in the evolution history. To recover issue-commit links, heuristic-based and learning-based techniques leverage the metadata and text/code similarity in issues and commits; however, they fail to capture the embedded semantics in issues and commits and the hidden semantic correlations between issues and commits. As a result, this semantic gap inhibits the accuracy of link recovery.

To bridge this gap, we propose a semantically-enhanced link recovery approach, named DeepLink, which is built on top of deep learning techniques. Specifically, we develop a neural network architecture, using word embedding and recurrent neural network, to learn the semantic representation of natural language descriptions and code in issues and commits as well as the semantic correlation between issues and commits. In experiments, to quantify the prevalence of missing issue-commit links, we analyzed 1078 highly-starred GitHub Java projects (i.e., 583,795 closed issues) and found that only 42.2% of issues were linked to corresponding commits. To evaluate the effectiveness of DeepLink, we compared DeepLink with a state-of-the-art link recovery approach FRLink using ten GitHub Java projects and demonstrated that DeepLink can outperform FRLink in terms of F-measure.",ar,2019-12-01,Journal of Systems and Software,,2-s2.0-85071724162,S0164121219301803,,Article,Ruan H.,,Fudan University;Shanghai Institute of Intelligent Electronics and Systems,Shanghai;Shanghai,China;China,,,,,December 2019,1641212,19309,,Journal,158,,110406,,0,,,,9,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121219301803?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por machine learning

To cope with this problem, this paper presents a novel replanning method based on receding horizon control and asymptotically optimal single-query motion planning. The approach, called the horizon-based lazy optimal rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm, enables real-time replanning in both static and dynamic environment with updated information. Previous feasible solutions are fully considered to generate new plans.

Behavior dynamics and rolling windows in global path planning methods have limitations in their applications because the path may not be optimal, there could be a pseudo attractor or blind search in an environment with a large state space, there could be an environment where offline learning is not applicable to real-time changes, or there could be a need to set the probability of selecting the robot action. To solve these problems, we propose a behavior dynamics and rolling windows approach to a path planning which is based on online reinforcement learning. It applies Q learning to optimize the behavior dynamics model parameters to improve the performance, behavior dynamics guides the learning process of Q learning and improves learning efficiency, and each round of intensive learning action selection knowledge is gradually corrected as the Q table is updated. The learning process is optimized. The simulation results show that this method has achieved remarkable improvement in path planning.

NO,10.1109/TSMC.2017.2750911,A Real-Time and Fully Distributed Approach to Motion Planning for Multirobot Systems,"Motion planning is one of the most critical problems in multirobot systems. The basic target is to generate a collision-free trajectory for each robot from its initial position to the target position. In this paper, we study the trajectory planning for the multirobot systems operating in unstructured and changing environments. Each robot is equipped with some sensors of limited sensing ranges. We propose a fully distributed approach to planning trajectories for such systems. It combines the model predictive control (MPC) strategy and the incremental sequential convex programming (iSCP) method. The MPC framework is applied to detect the local running environment real-timely with the concept of receding horizon. For each robot, a nonlinear programming is built in its current prediction horizon. To construct its own optimization problem, a robot first needs to communicate with its neighbors to retrieve their current states. Then, the robot predicts the neighbors' future positions in the current horizon and constructs the problem without waiting for the prediction information from its neighbors. At last, each robot solves its problem independently via the iSCP method such that the robot can move autonomously.

SI,10.1007/s40692-019-00147-3,Coding as another language: a pedagogical approach for teaching computer science in early childhood,"Computer programming is an essential skill in the 21st century and new policies and frameworks aim at preparing students for computer science-related professions. Today, the development of new interfaces and block-programming languages facilitates the teaching of coding and computational thinking starting in kindergarten. However, as new programming languages that are developmentally appropriate emerge, there is a need to explicitly conceptualize pedagogical approaches for teaching computer science in the early years that embrace the maturational stages of children by inviting play and discovery, socialization, and creativity. Thus, it is not enough to copy models developed for older children, which mostly grew out of traditional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines and instructional practices. This paper describes a pedagogical approach for early childhood computer science called “Coding as Another Language” (CAL), as well as six coding stages, or learning trajectories, that young children go through when exposed to CAL curriculum. CAL is grounded on the principle that learning to program involves learning how to use a new language (a symbolic system of representation) for communicative and expressive functions. This paper proposes that, due to the critical foundational role of language and literacy in the early years, the teaching of computer science can be augmented by models of literacy instruction. CAL supports young children in transitioning through different six coding stages. Case studies of young children using either the KIBO robot or the ScratchJr app will be used to characterize each coding stage and to illustrate the instructional practices of CAL curriculum.",ar,2019-12-01,Journal of Computers in Education,,2-s2.0-85074048340,,,Article,Bers M.U.,,Tufts University,Medford,United States,,,,,1 December 2019,21979987,21100922758,21979995,Journal,6,4,,499-528,0,,,,26,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40692-019-00147-3,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PIqQt_LbMbfsRry04aBbcPpwKpwUETFG/view?usp=sharing,"Revisar porque no sé si habla mucho de robótica

NO,10.1007/s10514-019-09875-y,A constrained instantaneous learning approach for aerial package delivery robots: onboard implementation and experimental results,"Rather than utilizing a sophisticated robot which is trained—and tuned—for a scenario in a specific environment perfectly, most people are interested in seeing robots operating in various conditions where they have never been trained before. In accordance with the goal of utilizing aerial robots for daily operations in real application scenarios, an aerial robot must learn from its own experience and its interactions with the environment. This paper presents an instantaneous learning-based control approach for the precise trajectory tracking of a 3D-printed aerial robot which can adapt itself to the changing working conditions. Considering the fact that model-based controllers suffer from lack of modeling, parameter variations and disturbances in their working environment, we observe that the presented learning-based control method has a compelling ability to significantly reduce the tracking error under aforementioned uncertainties throughout the operation. Three case scenarios are considered: payload mass variations on an aerial robot for a package delivery problem, ground effect when the aerial robot is hovering/flying close to the ground, and wind-gust disturbances encountered in the outdoor environment. In each case study, parameter variations are learned using nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE) method, and the estimated parameters are fed to the nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC). Thanks to learning capability of the presented framework, the aerial robot can learn from its own experience, and react promptly—unlike iterative learning control which allows the system to improve tracking accuracy from repetition to repetition—to reduce the tracking error. Additionally, the fast C++ execution of NMPC and NMHE codes facilitates a complete onboard implementation of the proposed framework on a low-cost embedded processor.",ar,2019-12-01,Autonomous Robots,,2-s2.0-85068868548,,,Article,Mehndiratta M.,,Singapore Centre for 3D Printing;School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Singapore City;Singapore City,Singapore;Singapore,,,,,1 December 2019,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,43,8,,2209-2228,0,,,,9,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-019-09875-y,,Excluido por no educación

To address the navigation problem, we propose a novel, machine learning-based algorithm called Semi-Markov Decision Process with Unawareness and Transfer (SMDPU-T) where a robot records a sequence of its actions around obstacles as action sequences called options which are then reused by it within a framework called Markov Decision Process with unawareness (MDPU) to learn suitable, collision-free maneuvers around more complex obstacles in future. We have analytically derived the cost bounds of the selected option by SMDPU-T and the worst case time complexity of our algorithm. Our experimental results on simulated robots within Webots simulator illustrate that SMDPU-T takes 24\% planning time and 39\% total time to solve same navigation tasks while, our hardware results on a Turtlebot robot indicate that SMDPU-T on average takes 53\% planning time and 60\% total time as compared to a recent, sampling-based path planner.",ar,2019-12-01,Autonomous Robots,,2-s2.0-85065662346,,,Article,Saha O.,,"LG Electronics, Korea",Seoul,South Korea,,,,,1 December 2019,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,43,8,,2071-2093,0,,,,6,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-019-09852-5,,Excluido por no educación (path planning)
NO,10.1145/3368858,Tiling optimizations for stencil computations using rewrite rules in lift,"Stencil computations are a widely used type of algorithm, found in applications from physical simulations to machine learning. Stencils are embarrassingly parallel, therefore fit on modern hardware such as Graphic Processing Units perfectly. Although stencil computations have been extensively studied, optimizing them for increasingly diverse hardware remains challenging. Domain-specific Languages (DSLs) have raised the programming abstraction and offer good performance; however, this method places the burden on DSL implementers to write almost full-fledged parallelizing compilers and optimizers.

Lift has recently emerged as a promising approach to achieve performance portability by using a small set of reusable parallel primitives that DSL or library writers utilize. Lift’s key novelty is in its encoding of optimizations as a system of extensible rewrite rules which are used to explore the optimization space.

This article demonstrates how complex multi-dimensional stencil code and optimizations are expressed using compositions of simple 1D Lift primitives and rewrite rules. We introduce two optimizations that provide high performance for stencils in particular: classical overlapped tiling for multi-dimensional stencils and 2.5D tiling specifically for 3D stencils. We provide an in-depth analysis on how the tiling optimizations affects stencils of different shapes and sizes across different applications.

The key technical idea behind our approach is to leverage tools from generalization theory in machine learning by exploiting a precise analogy (which we present in the form of a reduction) between generalization of control policies to novel environments and generalization of hypotheses in the supervised learning setting. In particular, we utilize the probably approximately correct (PAC)-Bayes framework, which allows us to obtain upper bounds that hold with high probability on the expected cost of (stochastic) control policies across novel environments. We propose policy learning algorithms that explicitly seek to minimize this upper bound. The corresponding optimization problem can be solved using convex optimization (relative entropy programming in particular) in the setting where we are optimizing over a finite policy space. In the more general setting of continuously parameterized policies (e.g., neural network policies), we minimize this upper bound using stochastic gradient descent. We present simulated results of our approach applied to learning (1) reactive obstacle avoidance policies and (2) neural network-based grasping policies. We also present hardware results for the Parrot Swing drone navigating through different obstacle environments. Our examples demonstrate the potential of our approach to provide strong generalization guarantees for robotic systems with continuous state and action spaces, complicated (e.g., nonlinear) dynamics, rich sensory inputs (e.g., depth images), and neural network-based policies.",ar,2020-01-01,International Journal of Robotics Research,generalization | Learning-based control | safety,2-s2.0-85092087418,,,Article,Majumdar A.,60003269,Princeton University,Princeton,United States,3,"Majumdar, Anirudha;Farid, Alec;Sonar, Anoopkumar",55325126200;57219298680;57219295257,60003269;60003269;60003269,2020,2783649,18050,17413176,Journal,,,,,0,NSF,IIS-1755038,National Science Foundation,0,2020,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364920959444,,Excluido por machine learning

However, due to the inherit trial-and-error learning mechanism of reinforcement learning and the time-consuming training of deep neural network itself, the convergence speed of DRL is very slow and consequently limits the real applications of DRL. In this paper, aiming to improve the convergence speed of DRL, we proposed a novel Steffensen value iteration (SVI) method by applying the Steffensen iteration to the value function iteration of off-policy DRL from the perspective of fixed-point iteration. The proposed SVI is theoretically proved to be convergent and have a faster convergence speed than Bellman value iteration. The proposed SVI has versatility, which can be easily combined with existing off-policy RL algorithms.

NO,10.1155/2020/3849309,Learning from Demonstrations and Human Evaluative Feedbacks: Handling Sparsity and Imperfection Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Programming by demonstrations is one of the most efficient methods for knowledge transfer to develop advanced learning systems, provided that teachers deliver abundant and correct demonstrations, and learners correctly perceive them. Nevertheless, demonstrations are sparse and inaccurate in almost all real-world problems. Complementary information is needed to compensate these shortcomings of demonstrations. In this paper, we target programming by a combination of nonoptimal and sparse demonstrations and a limited number of binary evaluative feedbacks, where the learner uses its own evaluated experiences as new demonstrations in an extended inverse reinforcement learning method. This provides the learner with a broader generalization and less regret as well as robustness in face of sparsity and nonoptimality in demonstrations and feedbacks. Our method alleviates the unrealistic burden on teachers to provide optimal and abundant demonstrations. Employing an evaluative feedback, which is easy for teachers to deliver, provides the opportunity to correct the learner's behavior in an interactive social setting without requiring teachers to know and use their own accurate reward function. Here, we enhance the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the reward function using a mixture of nonoptimal and sparse demonstrations and evaluative feedbacks. Our method, called IRL from demonstration and human's critique (IRLDC), has two phases. The teacher first provides some demonstrations for the learner to initialize its policy. Next, the learner interacts with the environment and the teacher provides binary evaluative feedbacks. Taking into account possible inconsistencies and mistakes in issuing and receiving feedbacks, the learner revises the estimated reward function by solving a single optimization problem. The IRLDC is devised to handle errors and sparsities in demonstrations and feedbacks and can generalize different combinations of these two sources expertise. We apply our method to three domains: a simulated navigation task, a simulated car driving problem with human interactions, and a navigation experiment of a mobile robot. The results indicate that the IRLDC significantly enhances the learning process where the standard IRL methods fail and learning from feedbacks (LfF) methods has a high regret. Also, the IRLDC works well at different levels of sparsity and optimality of the teacher's demonstrations and feedbacks, where other state-of-the-art methods fail.",ar,2020-01-01,Journal of Robotics,,2-s2.0-85078670070,,,Article,Mourad N.,60022927,University of Tehran,Tehran,Iran,4,"Mourad, Nafee;Ezzeddine, Ali;Nadjar Araabi, Babak;Nili Ahmadabadi, Majid",57202773807;57202777893;35560470000;57211371544,60022927;60022927;60022927;60022927,2020,16879600,21100301602,16879619,Journal,2020,,3849309,,1,,undefined,,0,2020,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jr/2020/3849309/,,Excluido por machine learning

However, the CSO algorithm performs relatively poorly in complex GOPs for some weaknesses, which results the iteration easily fall into a local minimum. An improved chicken swarm optimization algorithm (ICSO) is proposed and applied in robot path planning. Firstly, an improved search strategy with Levy flight characteristics is introduced in the hen's location update formula, which helps to increase the perturbation of the proposed algorithm and the diversity of the population. Secondly, a nonlinear weight reduction strategy is added in the chicken's position update formula, which may enhance the chicken's self-learning ability. Finally, multiple sets of unconstrained functions are used and a robot simulation experimental environment is established to test the ICSO algorithm. The numerical results show that, comparing to particle swarm optimization (PSO) and basic chicken swarm optimization (CSO), the ICSO algorithm has better convergence accuracy and stability for unconstrained optimization, and has stronger search capability in the robot path planning.",ar,2020-01-01,IEEE Access,Chicken swarm optimization algorithm | Levy flight | nonlinear weight reduction strategy | numerical experiments | robot path planning,2-s2.0-85082306006,,,Article,Liang X.,60108794;60092860,Guizhou University of Finance and Economics;Beijing University Of Civil Engineering And Architecture,Guiyang;Beijing,China;China,3,"Liang, Ximing;Kou, Dechang;Wen, Long",24923042900;57215896607;35176193000,60092860;60092860;60108794,2020,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,8,,9000844,49543-49550,1,NSFC,2016YFC0700601,National Natural Science Foundation of China,13,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9000844,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2978077,The experience-memory Q-Learning algorithm for robot path planning in unknown environment,"In order to solve the problem of slow convergence speed and long planned path when the robot plans a path in unknown environment by using Q-learning algorithm, we propose the Experience-Memory Q-Learning (EMQL) algorithm based on the continuous update of the shortest distance from the current state node to the start point. The autonomous learning ability of the robot is enhanced by the different role assignments of two tables in the proposed algorithm. EM table with (m∗1) dimension is designed to record the distance information, reflecting the learning process of the robot. Q table is adopted as an auxiliary guidance for the experience transfer strategy and experience reuse strategy, and these strategies enable the robot accomplish the task even if the destination is changed or the path is blocked. Further, the learning efficiency of the robot in the EMQL algorithm is improved by the dual reward mechanism consisting of static reward and dynamic reward. The static reward is designed to prevent the robot from exploring a state node excessively. The dynamic reward is responsible for helping the robot avoid searching blindly in unknown environment. We test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on both grid maps and road network maps. The comparison results in planning time, iteration times and path length show that the performance of the EMQL algorithm is superior to Q-learning algorithm in convergence speed and optimization ability. Additionally, the practicability of the proposed algorithm is validated in a real-world experiment using the Turtlebot3 burger robot.",ar,2020-01-01,IEEE Access,experience memory | experience reuse | experience transfer | Path planning | Q-learning,2-s2.0-85082173319,,,Article,Zhao M.,60013789;118307847,Beihang University;Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Integrated and Intelligent Navigation,Beijing;Xi'an,China;China,4,"Zhao, Meng;Lu, Hui;Yang, Siyi;Guo, Fengjuan",57215421200;55729811300;57215871993;55417293800,60013789;60013789-118307847;60013789;118307847,2020,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,8,,9022975,47824-47844,1,,SKLIIN-20180204,,7,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9022975,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1109/LRA.2019.2943818,A Cerebellar Internal Models Control Architecture for Online Sensorimotor Adaptation of a Humanoid Robot Acting in a Dynamic Environment,"Humanoid robots are often supposed to operate in non-deterministic human environments, and as a consequence, the robust and gentle rejection of the external perturbations is extremely crucial. In this scenario, stable and accurate behavior is mostly solved through adaptive control mechanisms that learn an internal model to predict the consequences of the outgoing control signals. Evidences show that brain-based biological systems resolve this control issue by updating an appropriate internal model that is then used to direct the muscles activities. Inspired by the biological cerebellar internal models theory, that couples forward and inverse internal models into the biological motor control scheme, we propose a novel methodology to artificially replicate these learning and adaptive principles into a robotic feedback controller. The proposed cerebellar-like network combines machine learning, artificial neural network, and computational neuroscience techniques to deal with all the nonlinearities and complexities that modern robotic systems could present. Although the architecture is tested on the simulated humanoid iCub, it can be applied to different robotic systems without excessive customization, thanks to its neural network-based nature. During the experiments, the robot is requested to follow repeatedly a movement while it is interacting with two external systems. Four different internal model architectures are compared and tested under different conditions. The comparison of the performances confirmed the theories about internal models combinatory action. The combination of models together with the structural and learning features of the network, resulted in a benefit to the adaptation mechanism, but also the system response to nonlinearities, noise and external forces.",ar,2020-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Biomimetics | control architectures and programming | learning and adaptive systems | model learning for control | Neurorobotics,2-s2.0-85072773298,,,Article,Capolei M.,60028039;60011373,Sant'Anna Scuola Universitaria Superiore Pisa;Technical University of Denmark,Pisa;Lyngby,Italy;Denmark,5,"Capolei, Marie Claire;Andersen, Nils Axel;Lund, Henrik Hautop;Falotico, Egidio;Tolu, Silvia",57194797555;57193604153;7103197655;35785672300;23394070700,60011373;60011373;60011373;60028039;60011373,January 2020,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,5,1,8848431,80-87,0,H2020,705100,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,9,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8848431,,Excluido por machine learning

The set of blocks can be easily extended implementing additional Python functions, without modifying the core code of the tool. Moreover, LearnBlock provides an integrated educational programming environment that facilitates a progressive transition from a visual to a general-purpose programming language.

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.",ar,2020-01-01,IEEE Access,basic programming | Emotional intelligence | robots based learning | screen-free interface,2-s2.0-85091848953,,,Article,Rafique M.,60138780;60056462,"University of Sialkot;University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore",Sialkot;Lahore,Pakistan;Pakistan,5,"Rafique, Memoona;Hassan, Muhammad Awais;Jaleel, Abdul;Khalid, Hina;Bano, Gulshan",57220472844;57221640958;57202131762;57201591732;57218550495,60056462;60056462;60056462;60056462;60138780,2020,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,8,,9163380,149616-149629,1,,undefined,,1,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9163380,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJOjjSBOKc0PdgWZn_4KcOXrYPsF2WTM/view?usp=sharing,"Juzgando por las imágenes mencionan algunas herramientas de programación por bloques para robots simulados y también un robot que, según entiendo, se puede programar dibujando órdenes en un papel (parece muy interesante)

NO,10.14201/eks.22366,"Computational thinking in early childhood education, beyond floor robots","Educational robotics, programming and computational thinking are being incorporated in the classrooms of many educational centres and at any age. In many cases, this incorporation in the curricula is well-argued and documented, but in other cases, it is done in a rash manner and without prior reflection. In Early Childhood Education, the development of computational thinking seems to have found in floor robots a tool that allows its improvement and progress. To verify if this is so, 50 experts (active teachers, trainers of future teachers and commercial technicians of educational robotics) from all over Spain were tested. The results show that although there is a high percentage of considering floor robots as an excellent tool for the development of computational thinking in Early Childhood Education, there is no consensus when using other types of practices that go beyond and also benefit this learning process. Therefore, we consider it necessary to establish a common framework and guidelines that allow the correct implementation of robotics, programming and computational thinking in Early Childhood Education.

Its ease of use allows the introduction of computer programming to young children in educational contexts from a science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) perspective. Despite this rise, there are still few investigations that collect evidence on the effectiveness of robotic interventions. Although mentoring experiences with robotics had been carried out in educational contexts, this work explores their effect on the acquisition of computational thinking skills through mentoring. Participants from the second grade, aged seven through eight years, were exposed to two sessions of robotics with Bee-bot in order to promote hands-on experimentation. The sessions were conducted by nine students of the fourth grade (the mentors), aged 10 to 11 years. A descriptive case-study methodology was employed for the analysis of the mentoring intervention. The effect of the mentoring experience was assessed in terms of motivation and computational thinking skills.

Considering the optimal environment for crop growth with energy efficiency, the optimization schemes of the greenhouse systems are studied in this paper. Different from current optimization methods, most of which are based on expert experience and parameter learning, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique for environmental parameters’ description. On this basis, a fast optimization scheme for greenhouse environmental system is proposed. In this method, several low-dimensional parameter subspaces of greenhouse environment are constructed using POD technique. They may be embedded into optimization loop for fast solving environment response. In our case study, NSGA-II algorithm is applied for the optimization of a real greenhouse's environment. The multiple objectives include crop area's temperature distribution, carbon dioxide concentration and related energy consumption.

The collision risk assessment method is based on the moving direction and position of robots, and the collision avoidance strategy is based on the artificial potential field (APF) and the fuzzy inference system (FIS). The traditional artificial potential field (TAPF) has the problem of the local minimum, which will be optimized by improving the repulsive field function. To adjust the speed of the robot adaptively and improve the security performance of the system, the FIS is used to plan the speed of robots. The hybridization of the improved artificial potential field (IAPF) and the FIS will make each robot safely and quickly find a collision-free path from the starting position to the target position in a completely unknown environment.

NO,10.1155/2020/7842768,Multi-USV System Cooperative Underwater Target Search Based on Reinforcement Learning and Probability Map,"Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is a robotic system with autonomous planning, driving, and navigation capabilities. With the continuous development of applications, the missions faced by USV are becoming more and more complex, so it is difficult for a single USV to meet the mission requirements. Compared with a single USV, a multi-USV system has some outstanding advantages such as fewer perceptual constraints, larger operation ranges, and stronger operation capability. In the search mission about multiple stationary underwater targets by a multi-USV system in the environment with obstacles, we propose a novel cooperative search algorithm (CSBDRL) based on reinforcement learning (RL) method and probability map method. CSBDRL is composed of the environmental sense module and policy module, which are organized by the ""divide and conquer"" policy-based architecture. The environmental sense module focuses on providing environmental sense values by using the probability map method. The policy module focuses on learning the optimal policy by using RL method. In CSBDRL, the mission environment is modeled and the corresponding reward function is designed to effectively explore the environment and learning policies. We test CSBDRL in the simulation environment and compare it with other methods. The results prove that compared with other methods, CSBDRL makes the multi-USV system have a higher search efficiency, which can ensure targets are found more quickly and accurately while ensuring the USV avoids obstacles in time during the mission.",ar,2020-01-01,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,,2-s2.0-85085568741,,,Article,Liu Y.,60023813,Shanghai University,Shanghai,China,5,"Liu, Yuan;Peng, Yan;Wang, Min;Xie, Jiajia;Zhou, Rui",57192564229;36617766500;57211926358;57215671108;57202916687,60023813;60023813;60023813;60023813;60023813,2020,1024123X,13082,15635147,Journal,2020,,7842768,,1,NSFC,61403245,National Natural Science Foundation of China,4,2020,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2020/7842768/,,Excluido por machine learning

When an appropriate tool is not available, a very useful ability for a robot is to create a novel one based on its experience. With the advent of inexpensive 3D printing, it is now possible to give robots such an ability, at least to create simple tools. We proposed a method for learning how to use an object as a tool and, if needed, to design and construct a new tool. The robot began by learning an action model of tool use for a PDDL planner by observing a trainer. It then refined the model by learning by trial and error. Tool creation consisted of generalising an existing tool model and generating a novel tool by instantiating the general model. Further learning by experimentation was performed. Reducing the search space of potentially useful tools could be achieved by providing a tool ontology. We then used a constraint solver to obtain numerical parameters from abstract descriptions and use them for a ready-to-print design.

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997636,Development and Stability Analysis of an Imitation Learning-Based Pose Planning Approach for Multi-Section Continuum Robot,"Recently, continuum flexible robots have been designed for the use in diverse applications; including the exploration of confined static and dynamic environments. One of the challenging tasks for those robots is planning optimal trajectories due to, not only the redundant Degrees of Freedom (DOF) they own but also their compliant behaviour. In this paper, an Imitation-based Pose Planning (IbPP) approach is proposed to teach a two-section continuum robot the motion primitives that will facilitate achieving and generalizing for spatial point-to-point motion which involves both position and orientation goals encoded in a dual quaternion form. Two novel approaches are proposed in this research to intuitively generate the motion demonstrations that will be used in the proposed IbPP. Namely, a flexible input interface, acting as a twin robot, is designed to allow a human to demonstrate different motions for the robot end-effector. Alternatively, as a second approach, the Microsoft Kinect sensor is used to provide motion demonstrations faster via human arm movements. Based on the kinematic model of the two-section continuum robot, a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithm is developed to achieve tracking the generated trajectory from the IbPP and to guarantee the robustness against the model uncertainties and external disturbances. Moreover, controller stability analysis is developed based on Lyapunov criteria. Finally, simulations are conducted for the two-section continuum robot to prove the ability of the proposed IbPP with the two proposed inputs to learn and generalize for spatial motions, which in future could be easily accommodated for robots with multiple sections. In addition, the proposed MRAC shows a significant performance towards following the required trajectory and rejecting the external disturbance.",ar,2020-01-01,IEEE Access,Continuum robot | kinect sensor | kinematic control | kinematic modeling | motion planning,2-s2.0-85086299613,,,Article,Seleem I.A.,60117075;60026112;60023462,Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology;Benha University;Waseda University,New Borg El-Arab;Benha;Tokyo,Egypt;Egypt;Japan,4,"Seleem, Ibrahim A.;El-Hussieny, Haitham;Assal, Samy F.M.;Ishii, Hiroyuki",57192209663;20433398600;8571391800;55540329100,60117075;60026112;60117075;60023462,2020,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,8,,9099824,99366-99379,1,E-JUST,undefined,Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology,3,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9099824,,Excluido por machine learning

To address functional expressiblity, a key limitation of the black-box machine learning methods, we have exploited the use of symbolic regression as a principle for identifying relations and operators that are related to the underlying processes. This approach combines evolutionary computation with feature engineering to provide a tool for discovering hidden parameterizations embedded in the trajectory of fluid flows in the Eulerian frame of reference. Our approach in this study mainly involves gene expression programming (GEP) and sequential threshold ridge regression (STRidge) algorithms. We demonstrate our results in three different applications: (i) equation discovery, (ii) truncation error analysis, and (iii) hidden physics discovery, for which we include both predicting unknown source terms from a set of sparse observations and discovering subgrid scale closure models. We illustrate that both GEP and STRidge algorithms are able to distill the Smagorinsky model from an array of tailored features in solving the Kraichnan turbulence problem.

The developed search algorithm will be implemented and tested on multiple rovers, a.k.a. Swarmies or Swarm Robots. Swarmies are compact rovers, designed by NASA to mimic Ants behavior and perform an autonomous search for simulated Mars resources. This effort aimed to assist NASA's mission to explore the space and discover new resources on the Moon and Mars. NASA's going-on project has the goal to send robots that explore and collect resources for analysis before sending Astronauts, as the swarm option is safer and more affordable. All rovers must utilize the exact algorithm and collaborate and cooperate to find all available resources in their search path and retrieve them to the space station location. Additionally, swarmies will autonomously search while avoiding obstacles and mapping the surrounding environment for future missions. This algorithm allows a swarm of six robots to search an unknown area for simulated resources called AprilTags (cubes with QR codes).

NO,10.28945/4532,"Technological structure for technology integration in the classroom, inspired by the maker culture","Aim/Purpose This paper presented the framework for the integration of digital technolo-gies in education, implemented in InTecEdu Program, developed by Remote Experimentation Laboratory (RExLab), Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil. Background The main objective of the model presented is to arouse interest in science and technology among adolescents. Therefore, it sought to develop STEM competencies (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in chil-dren and adolescents. Understanding learning in STAM areas can favor the development of professionals who can supply the demand in related sectors, especially in the scientific-technological scope. To fulfill the main objective, strategies related to students and teachers were developed. With activities aimed at students, it was hoped to promote vocations to scientific-technolog-ical careers and encourage entrepreneurship. On the other hand, the activities related to teachers aimed at training them to integrate technology into their lesson plans. Inspired by the Maker Culture, the model sought to make it possible for teachers to become the main agents in the process of integrating technology in their lesson plans, since they were in charge of building and producing their digital content and other resources to support their didactic activities. The maker movement is a technological extension of the ""Do It Yourself!"" culture, which encourages ordinary people to build, modify, repair, and manufacture their objects, with their own hands. The training actions were preceded by a diagnosis, inspired by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, as well as the lesson plans prepared and made available by the teachers. Methodology Methodologically, the framework's work plan was composed of five Work Packages (WP), which include management, resource mapping, strategies re-lated to teachers, strategies related to students, and the dissemination and ex-ploitation of results. In the 2014-2018 period, 367 teachers participated in training activities, intending to integrate technologies into lesson plans. At the end of 2018, 27 Basic Education schools, including an indigenous and a rural school, from the public-school system, in the states of Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, and the Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, using the project's Vir-tual Learning Environment (VLE). In these 70 teachers, 230 classes, and 6,766 students accessed didactic content, produced by teachers, at VLE. Also, 20 laboratories were available in 26 instances, for use in practical activi-ties in disciplines in the STEM areas. Specifically, in the STEM areas, 3,360 students from 98 classes from 9 schools had integrated the Remote Labora-tories, in lesson plans in the subjects of Physics and Biology (High School), Science (Elementary School). Contribution The main results of the application of the framework are related to the train-ing of human resources, knowledge production, and educational innovation. About the training of human resources, we sought to contribute to the train-ing of teachers concerning technology in education and, with that, arouse greater interest on the part of students, as well as obtain improvements in their learning from teaching methodologies supported on the use of digital technologies. On the other hand, the production of knowledge, in the pro-gram and the socialization of research, is favored by the model based on open-source resources, both in terms of software and hardware and with open educational resources. This characteristic favor and expands the poten-tial for reapplying research and, consequently, its contribution to educational innovation. Findings The results, about students, indicated an increase in motivation due to the creation of new teaching and learning opportunities. The fact of extending the classroom and school, through remote laboratories, to support practical activities and the use of VLE, was also pointed out as a very positive factor. On the other hand, the realization of the workshops, inspired by practices of the Maker Culture, provided an approximation of these to the skills of the real world, which will certainly favor their employability. Regarding the teach-ers, it is noticed the continuity and expansion in the use of technological re-sources in the classroom; many sought and have participated in new training actions. Recommendations for Practitioners Provision of a repository of practices for sharing and reuse of lesson plans developed by teachers participating in the research. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Recommendations for Researchers Technical documents, manuals, and guides for remote laboratories. Data col-lected in the applied questionnaires. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Impact on Society The main results of the framework application are related to human re-sources formation, knowledge production, and educational innovation. Re-garding the formation of human resources, we sought to contribute to the formation of teachers concerning technology in education and, about the stu-dents the creation of teaching and learning opportunities, to extend the class-room and also the school, through the remote laboratories, to support the practical activities and the use of the VLE.

In particular, there is an indication that the inadequacy of a general approach to analyzing compliance documents impedes adequate compliance management practice. Taking an algorithmic-centric approach to tackling this challenge, this paper aims at providing an automated system that extracts, classifies and analyses compliance management documents in different domains. This paper tested and proposed machine learning techniques and systematically outlined algorithms for efficient extraction, classification and analysis of dataflow, control flow, and time constraints in compliance management domain for different stakeholders. The designed system was implemented using software tools. The classification was done in python Programming Language Environment using Machine Learning Algorithms while the Extraction and Analysis algorithms were implemented in Java programming language.

NO,10.1007/s10514-019-09891-y,Learning quasi-periodic robot motions from demonstration,"The goal of Learning from Demonstration is to automatically transfer the skill knowledge from human to robot. Current researches focus on the problem of modeling aperiodic/periodic robot motions and extracting dynamic task parameters from the recorded sensory information. However, it is still not adequate for describing complex behaviors in an unstructured environment, such as searching for an unknown fitting position or painting/polishing an irregular surface. The quasi-periodic and stochastic properties cause a high demand for generalization ability of the modeling techniques. This paper proposes a systematic framework for learning quasi-periodic robot motions, which contains three steps: decomposition, modeling, and synthesization. Firstly FFT transform is performed to identify all the frequencies in the quasi-periodic motion. Then the motion is decomposed into an offset component, a series of harmonic and corresponding envelop components based on the concept of equivalent transformation. The offset component is extracted by Empirical Mode Decomposition, harmonic is separated by notch filter, and envelope component is extracted by Hilbert Transform. These components are either periodic or aperiodic. The aperiodic motions can be modeled by conventional techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Model and recovered by Gaussian Mixture Regression. The periodic motions are modeled in closed-form expressions. Finally, they are synthesized together to regenerate the robot motion. This modeling process captures both the aperiodicity and periodicity of a quasi-periodic motion. Simulation and experiment show that the proposed methods are feasible, effective and can predict robot motions beyond demonstrations. With this generalization ability, it is able to reduce the programming difficulty and demonstration complexity.",ar,2020-01-01,Autonomous Robots,GMM/GMR | Learning from demonstration | Quasi-periodic motion,2-s2.0-85074599166,,,Article,Li X.,60031863;60030452,Northeastern University;Texas State University,Shenyang;San Marcos,China;United States,4,"Li, Xiao;Cheng, Hongtai;Chen, Heping;Chen, Jiaming",57202950272;55364416300;37103518000;57202942125,60031863;60031863;60030452;60031863,1 January 2020,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,44,2,,251-266,0,NSFC,61503067,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-019-09891-y,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.4316/AECE.2020.04003,Fault Tolerant Distributed Python Software Transactional Memory,"Much of the previous research has been done on distributed software transactional memories targeting data centers in Internet clouds, which resulted in nondeterministic and nonrealtime middleware solutions mainly written in Java and C++. On the other hand, embedded systems based on the Internet of Things at the edge of the Internet, such as smart homes, cars, etc., need to operate in realtime, and should, therefore, be deterministic. In order to be smart, these systems use machine learning, and nowadays Python is becoming a leading language in this venue, too. This is the first paper that presents a distributed software transactional memory that is at the same time: (i) fault tolerant, (ii) deterministic, (iii) based on Python, and (iv) extended from a formally verified root. The presented solution consists of a pair of master-slave transaction coordinators and a set of replicated data servers and targets small-to-medium edge networks. Besides intelligent embedded systems, based on the Internet of Things, it can be also used in a wide range of application domains, from SCADA systems to large-scale simulations.

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974051,Two-Step CNN Framework for Text Line Recognition in Camera-Captured Images,"In this paper, we introduce an 'on the device' text line recognition framework that is designed for mobile or embedded systems. We consider per-character segmentation as a language-independent problem and individual character recognition as a language-dependent one. Thus, the proposed solution is based on two separate artificial neural networks (ANN) and dynamic programming instead of employing image processing methods for the segmentation step or end-to-end ANN. To satisfy the tight constraints on memory size imposed by embedded systems and to avoid overfitting, we employ ANNs with a small number of trainable parameters. The primary purpose of our framework is the recognition of low-quality images of identity documents with complex backgrounds and a variety of languages and fonts. We demonstrate that our solution shows high recognition accuracy on natural datasets even being trained on purely synthetic data. We use MIDV-500 and Census 1961 Project datasets for text line recognition. The proposed method considerably surpasses the algorithmic method implemented in Tesseract 3.05, the LSTM method (Tesseract 4.00), and unpublished method used in the ABBYY FineReader 15 system.

Programming by Demonstration gives a better opportunity for solving this problem by tracking the user’s movements with a motion capture system and creating a robotic program to reproduce the performed tasks. This paper presents a Programming by Demonstration system in a trajectory level for the reproduction of hand/tool movement by a manipulator robot; this was realized by tracking the user’s movement with the ArToolkit and reconstructing the trajectories by using the constrained cubic spline. The results obtained with the constrained cubic spline were compared with cubic spline interpolation.

This work presents a novel approach to solve the CPP problem in large complex environments based on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) leveraging the grid-based maps. The proposed algorithm applies the cellular decomposition methods to decompose the environment and generate the coverage path by recursively solving each decomposed cell formulated as TSP. A solution to TSP is determined by training Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We validated the proposed method by systematically benchmarked with other conventional methods in terms of path length, execution time, and overlapping rate under four different map layouts with various obstacle density.

Based on the analysis of biological habits, when the creature enters blind alley during the foraging process, it will retreat a distance and then restart the search process. We introduce a fallback mechanism in the traditional beetle antenna search algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm possesses the characteristic of low time complexity. It can plan a collision-free path in a short period of time. Moreover, the effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified by simulations in different types of environments and comparisons with existing path planning algorithms.",ar,2020-02-01,Soft Computing,Fallback beetle antennae search (FBAS) | Mobile robots | Obstacle avoidance | Optimization | Path planning,2-s2.0-85066622576,,,Article,Wu Q.,60013614;60008928;60003970,Hangzhou Dianzi University;Hong Kong Polytechnic University;Zhejiang University,Hangzhou;Kowloon;Hangzhou,China;Hong Kong;China,6,"Wu, Qing;Lin, Hao;Jin, Yuanzhe;Chen, Zeyu;Li, Shuai;Chen, Dechao",57199303484;57209139477;57208625796;57208622532;55986486700;56118671600,60013614;60013614;60003970;60013614;60008928;60013614,1 February 2020,14327643,28554,14337479,Journal,24,3,,2369-2380,0,NSFC,UA7L,National Natural Science Foundation of China,24,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00500-019-04067-3,,Excluido por no educación (path planning)
NO,10.1007/s10766-019-00647-w,Message Passing Optimization in Robot Operating System,"With the development of deep learning, autonomous robot systems grow rapidly and require better performance. Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) has been widely adopted as the main communication framework in autonomous robot systems. However, the performance of ROS2 has become the bottleneck of these real-time systems. From our observations, we find that it can take a large amount of time to serialize complex message in communication, especially for some high-level programming languages, including Python, Java and so on. To address this challenge, we propose a novel technique, called adaptive two-layer serialization algorithm, which can achieve good performance in communication for different kinds of messages. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve significant performance improvement over traditional methods in ROS2, up to 93% improvement in our framework.

NO,10.3390/s20030642,3d trajectory planning method for UAVs swarm in building emergencies,"The development in Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) has become one of the most exploited fields of research in robotics in recent years. This is due to the robustness and versatility they present to effectively undertake a set of tasks autonomously. One of the essential elements for several vehicles, in this case, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), to perform tasks autonomously and cooperatively is trajectory planning, which is necessary to guarantee the safe and collision-free movement of the different vehicles. This document includes the planning of multiple trajectories for a swarm of UAVs based on 3D Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM). This swarm is capable of reaching different locations of interest in different cases (labeled and unlabeled), supporting of an Emergency Response Team (ERT) in emergencies in urban environments. In addition, an architecture based on Robot Operating System (ROS) is presented to allow the simulation and integration of the methods developed in a UAV swarm. This architecture allows the communications with the MavLink protocol and control via the Pixhawk autopilot, for a quick and easy implementation in real UAVs. The proposed method was validated by experiments simulating building emergences. Finally, the obtained results show that methods based on probability roadmaps create effective solutions in terms of calculation time in the case of scalable systems in different situations along with their integration into a versatile framework such as ROS.",ar,2020-02-01,Sensors (Switzerland),3D probabilistic roadmaps | Multi-robot systems | Trajectory planning | UAV,2-s2.0-85078252566,,31979281,Article,Madridano Á.,60001741,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,Madrid,Spain,4,"Madridano, Ángel;Al-Kaff, Abdulla;Martín, David;de la Escalera, Arturo",57212306467;56308645100;57213252262;6602500615,60001741;60001741;60001741;60001741,1 February 2020,14248220,130124,,Journal,20,3,642,,1,,IND2017/TIC-7834,Comunidad de Madrid,22,2020,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/3/642,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.3390/s20030706,Depth image–based deep learning of grasp planning for textureless planar-faced objects in vision-guided robotic bin-picking,"Bin-picking of small parcels and other textureless planar-faced objects is a common task at warehouses. A general color image–based vision-guided robot picking system requires feature extraction and goal image preparation of various objects. However, feature extraction for goal image matching is difficult for textureless objects. Further, prior preparation of huge numbers of goal images is impractical at a warehouse. In this paper, we propose a novel depth image–based vision-guided robot bin-picking system for textureless planar-faced objects. Our method uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model that is trained on 15,000 annotated depth images synthetically generated in a physics simulator to directly predict grasp points without object segmentation. Unlike previous studies that predicted grasp points for a robot suction hand with only one vacuum cup, our DCNN also predicts optimal grasp patterns for a hand with two vacuum cups (left cup on, right cup on, or both cups on). Further, we propose a surface feature descriptor to extract surface features (center position and normal) and refine the predicted grasp point position, removing the need for texture features for vision-guided robot control and sim-to-real modification for DCNN model training. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our system, namely that a robot with 7 degrees of freedom can pick randomly posed textureless boxes in a cluttered environment with a 97.5% success rate at speeds exceeding 1000 pieces per hour.",ar,2020-02-01,Sensors (Switzerland),Bin picking | Deep learning | Grasp planning | Textureless | Visual servoing,2-s2.0-85078798997,,32012874,Article,Jiang P.,60018735,Toshiba Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,7,"Jiang, Ping;Ishihara, Yoshiyuki;Sugiyama, Nobukatsu;Oaki, Junji;Tokura, Seiji;Sugahara, Atsushi;Ogawa, Akihito",57214440027;57214469559;57214472291;6602443075;7006984195;57191221117;7402000195,60018735;60018735;60018735;60018735;60018735;60018735;60018735,1 February 2020,14248220,130124,,Journal,20,3,706,,1,,undefined,,12,2020,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/3/706,,Excluido por machine learning

NO,10.1108/AA-11-2018-0188,An extended DMP framework for robot learning and improving variable stiffness manipulation,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a method which enables a robot to learn both motion skills and stiffness profiles from humans through kinesthetic human-robot cooperation. Design Methodology Approach: Admittance control is applied to allow robot-compliant behaviors when following the reference trajectories. By extending the dynamical movement primitives (DMP) model, a new concept of DMP and stiffness primitives is introduced to encode a kinesthetic demonstration as a combination of trajectories and stiffness profiles, which are subsequently transferred to the robot. Electromyographic signals are extracted from a human’s upper limbs to obtain target stiffness profiles. By monitoring vibrations of the end-effector velocities, a stability observer is developed. The virtual damping coefficient of admittance controller is adjusted accordingly to eliminate the vibrations. Findings: The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated experimentally. The result shows that the robot can perform tasks in a variable stiffness mode as like the human dose in the teaching phase. Originality Value: DMP has been widely used as a teaching by demonstration method to represent movements of humans and robots. The proposed method extends the DMP framework to allow a robot to learn not only motion skills but also stiffness profiles.

NO,10.1002/cae.22188,A teaching method for the theory and application of robot kinematics based on MATLAB and V-REP,"With the continuous development of the world, robots are necessary for achieving high production rates and competitiveness. With an increasing robot demand, many universities offer robotics courses. These courses teach students the mathematical principles of robot-related algorithms. However, it is difficult for students to apply pure mathematical algorithms in robotics to real robot development in a traditional classroom. This paper's motivation is to present a new robotics teaching method: Algorithm, Virtual experiment, Programming and Controller (AVPC), which shows students the steps of complete robot algorithm development, verification, and application process, taking the kinematics of an educational desktop 6-DOF robotic arm as a typical teaching case. For the low-cost educational desktop six-axis robotic arm, an inverse kinematics algorithm is proposed. The inverse solution algorithm is realized in MATLAB, and then the dynamic model of the desktop robotic arm is established in Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP). The inverse kinematics algorithm in MATLAB is used to control the virtual robot arm movement in V-REP to the specified position and orientation through the application programming interface (API) interface, thus verifying the correctness of the inverse kinematics algorithm. The inverse algorithm is implemented by using C language function in the microcontroller, and the running time of the algorithm is compared with that of the iterative solution method. In the present study, we investigated the students’ feelings and exam scores of using the new teaching method.

NO,10.1016/j.ast.2019.105657,Reinforcement learning in dual-arm trajectory planning for a free-floating space robot,"A free-floating space robot exhibits strong dynamic coupling between the arm and the base, and the resulting position of the end of the arm depends not only on the joint angles but also on the state of the base. Dynamic modeling is complicated for multiple degree of freedom (DOF) manipulators, especially for a space robot with two arms. Therefore, the trajectories are typically planned offline and tracked online. However, this approach is not suitable if the target has relative motion with respect to the servicing space robot. To handle this issue, a model-free reinforcement learning strategy is proposed for training a policy for online trajectory planning without establishing the dynamic and kinematic models of the space robot. The model-free learning algorithm learns a policy that maps states to actions via trial and error in a simulation environment. With the learned policy, which is represented by a feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers, the space robot can schedule and perform actions quickly and can be implemented for real-time applications.

NO,10.1007/s11412-020-09318-2,Unpacking the relationship between existing and new measures of physiological synchrony and collaborative learning: a mixed methods study,"Over the last decade, there has been a renewed interest in capturing twenty-first century skills using new data collection tools. In this article, we leverage an existing dataset where electrodermal activity (EDA) was used to identify markers of productive collaboration. The data came from 42 pairs of participants (N = 84) who had no coding experience and were asked to program a robot to solve a variety of mazes. Because little is known on how physiological synchrony relates to collaborative learning, we explored four different measures of synchrony: Signal Matching (SM), Instantaneous Derivative Matching (IDM), Directional Agreement (DA) and Pearson’s Correlation (PC). Overall, we found PC to be positively associated with learning gains (r = 0.35) and DA with collaboration quality (r = 0.3). To gain further insights into these results, we also qualitatively analyzed two groups and identified situations with high or low physiological synchrony. We observed higher synchrony values when members of a productive group reacted to an external event (e.g., following instructions, receiving a hint), oscillations when they were watching a video or interacting with each other, and lower values when they were programming and / or seem to be confused. Based on these results, we developed a new measure of collaboration using electrodermal data: we computed the number of cycles between low and high synchronization.

The robot with this framework can continuously learn from multiple or changing environments where it encounters different numbers of obstacles moving in unknown ways at different times. Using both planned trajectories from a real-time motion planner and already executed trajectories as feedback observations, our reinforcement learning agent enables the robot to adapt motion behaviors to environmental changes. The agent contains a Q network connected to a long short-term memory network. The proposed framework is tested in both simulations and real robot experiments over various, dynamically varied task environments.

Through data analytics techniques, the authors will explore the activities' output from a pedagogical and quantitative point of view. Sensors are utilized in the context of an Educational Robotics activity to obtain a more effective robot–environment interaction. Pupils work on specific exercises to make their robot smarter and to carry out more complex and inspirational projects: the integration of sensors on a robotic prototype is crucial, and learners have to comprehend how to use them. In the presented study, the potential of Educational Data Mining is used to investigate how a group of primary and secondary school students, using visual programming (Lego Mindstorms EV3 Education software), design programming sequences while they are solving an exercise related to an ultrasonic sensor mounted on their robotic artifact. For this purpose, a tracking system has been designed so that every programming attempt performed by students' teams is registered on a log file and stored in an SD card installed in the Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick. These log files are then analyzed using machine learning techniques (k-means clustering) in order to extract different patterns in the creation of the sequences and extract various problem-solving pathways performed by students.

Although they provide a valuable platform for the collection of data for Deep Learning and related AI approaches, such tools are deliberately designed to be general (supporting air, ground, and water vehicles) and feature-rich. The sheer amount of code required to support such broad capabilities can make it a daunting task to adapt these tools to building neurorobotic systems for flight. In this paper we present a complementary pair of simple, object-oriented software tools (multirotor flight-control firmware and simulation platform), each consisting of a core of a few thousand lines of C++ code, that we offer as a candidate solution to this challenge. By providing a minimalist application programming interface (API) for sensors and PID controllers, our software tools make it relatively painless for engineers to prototype neuromorphic approaches to MAV sensing and navigation. We conclude our discussion by presenting a simple PID controller we built using the popular Nengo neural simulator in conjunction with our flight-simulation platform.",ar,2020-03-16,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,drones | flight simulator | miniature aerial vehicles | PID control | spiking neural network,2-s2.0-85082672598,,,Article,Levy S.D.,60023603,Washington and Lee University,Lexington,United States,1,"Levy, Simon D.",7402774486,60023603,16 March 2020,,21100199837,16625218,Journal,14,,16,,1,,undefined,,2,2020,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2020.00016/full,,Excluido por machine learning

Through combining remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and deep learning, relevant research methodologies, biological applications and theoretical foundation of this research domain have been advancing speedily in recent years. This article first introduces the current trends of plant phenomics and its related progress in China and worldwide. Then, it focuses on discussing the characteristics of indoor phenotyping and phenotypic traits that are suitable for indoor experiments, including yield, quality, and stress related traits such as drought, cold and heat resistance, salt stress, heavy metals, and pests. By connecting key phenotypic traits with important biological questions in yield production, crop quality and Stress-related tolerance, we associated indoor phenotyping hardware with relevant biological applications and their plant model systems, for which a range of indoor phenotyping devices and platforms are listed and categorized according to their throughput, sensor integration, platform size, and applications. Additionally, this article introduces existing data management solutions and analysis software packages that are representative for phenotypic analysis. For example, ISA-Tab and MIAPPE ontology standards for capturing metadata in plant phenotyping experiments, PHIS and CropSight for managing complicated datasets, and Python or MATLAB programming languages for automated image analysis based on libraries such as OpenCV, Scikit-Image, MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox. Finally, due to the importance of extracting meaningful information from big phenotyping datasets, this article pays extra attention to the future development of plant phenomics in China, with suggestions and recommendations for the integration of multi-scale phenotyping data to increase confidence in research outcomes, the cultivation of cross-disciplinary researchers to lead the next-generation plant research, as well as the collaboration between academia and industry to enable world-leading research activities in the near future.",ar,2020-03-20,Smart Agriculture,Indoor phenotyping platform | Phenotypic analysis | Phenotyping data management | Plant phenomics | Quality-related traits | Resistance-related phenotypes | Yield-related traits,2-s2.0-85116896933,,,Article,Xu L.,60024045;60001601,Nanjing Agricultural University;National Institute of Agricultural Botany,Nanjing;Cambridge,China;United Kingdom,7,"Xu, Lingxiang;Chen, Jiawei;Ding, Guohui;Lu, Wei;Ding, Yanfeng;Zhu, Yan;Zhou, Ji",57191693617;57291925200;57213625389;57291925300;57266012200;57292147800;57193648853,60024045;60024045;60024045;60024045;60024045;60024045;60024045-60001601,20 March 2020,20968094,21101061461,,Journal,2,1,,23-42,0,,undefined,,4,2020,https://doi.org/10.12133/j.smartag.2020.2.1.202003-SA002,,Excluido por nada que ver (agriculture?)
NO,10.3390/A13040093,Path planning for laser cladding robot on artificial joint surface based on topology reconstruction,"Artificial joint surface coating is a hot issue in the interdisciplinary fields of manufacturing, materials and biomedicine. Due to the complex surface characteristics of artificial joints, there are some problems with effciency and precision in automatic cladding path planning for coating fabrication. In this study, a path planning method for a laser cladding robot for artificial joints surface was proposed. The key of this method was the topological reconstruction of the artificial joint surface. On the basis of the topological relation, a set of parallel planes were used to intersect the CAD model to generate a set of continuous, directed and equidistant surface transversals on the artificial joint surface. The arch height error method was used to extract robot interpolation points from surface transversal lines according to machining accuracy requirements. The coordinates and normal vectors of interpolation points were used to calculate the position and pose of the robot tool center point (TCP). To ensure that the laser beam was always perpendicular to the artificial joint surface, a novel laser cladding set-up with a robot was designed, of which the joint part clamped by a six-axis robot moved while the laser head was fixed on the workbench. The proposed methodology was validated with the planned path on the surface of an artificial acetabular cup using simulation and experimentation via an industrial NACHI robot. The results indicated that the path planning method based on topological reconstruction was feasible and more effcient than the traditional robot teaching method.",ar,2020-04-01,Algorithms,Artificial joint | Laser cladding robot | Path planning | Topological relation,2-s2.0-85084478912,,,Article,Li Y.,60017060,Central South University,Changsha,China,3,"Li, Yuanjin;Chen, Tao;Liu, Defu",57216745835;57221071961;55730551200,60017060;60017060;60017060,1 April 2020,,21100199795,19994893,Journal,13,4,93,,1,NSFC,CSUZC201919,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2,2020,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/13/4/93,,Excluido por nada que ver

NO,10.1109/LRA.2020.2969937,Exploiting bias for cooperative planning in multi-agent tree search,"Graph search over states and actions is a valuable tool for robotic planning and navigation. However, the required computation is sensitive to the size of the state and action spaces, a fact which is further exacerbated in multi-agent planning by the number of agents and the presence of sparse reward signals dependent on the cooperation of agents. To tackle these problems, we introduce an algorithm that is pre-trained in a centralized fashion but implemented on robots in a distributed way at runtime. The centralized portion uses imitation learning to iteratively construct policies that help guide an individual agent's own runtime search as well as predict other agents' future actions by exploiting previously discovered joint actions. Our algorithm includes a novel method of tree search based on a mixture of the individual and joint action space, which can be interpreted as a cascading effect where agents are biased by exploration of new actions, exploitation of previously profitable ones, and recommendation provided by deep neural nets.

One class of tiling robotics, polyomino-based reconfigurable robots, overcome the limitation of fixed-form robots in achieving high-efficiency area coverage by adopting different morphologies to suit the needs of the current environment. Since the reconfigurable actions of these robots are produced by real-time intelligent decisions during operations, an optimal path planning algorithm is paramount to maximize the area coverage while minimizing the energy consumed by these robots. This paper proposes a complete coverage path planning (CCPP) model trained using deep blackreinforcement learning (RL) for the tetromino based reconfigurable robot platform called hTetro to simultaneously generate the optimal set of shapes for any pretrained arbitrary environment shape with a trajectory that has the least overall cost. To this end, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers is trained using Actor Critic Experience Replay (ACER) reinforcement learning algorithm. The results are compared with existing approaches which are based on the traditional tiling theory model, including zigzag, spiral, and greedy search schemes. The model is also compared with the Travelling salesman problem (TSP) based Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) schemes. The proposed scheme generates a path with lower cost while also requiring lesser time to generate it.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2020.2970945,Learning to Walk a Tripod Mobile Robot Using Nonlinear Soft Vibration Actuators with Entropy Adaptive Reinforcement Learning,"Soft mobile robots have shown great potential in unstructured and confined environments by taking advantage of their excellent adaptability and high dexterity. However, there are several issues to be addressed, such as actuating speeds and controllability, in soft robots. In this letter, a new vibration actuator is proposed using the nonlinear stiffness characteristic of a hyperelastic material, which creates continuous vibration of the actuator. By integrating three proposed actuators, we also present an advanced soft mobile robot with high degrees of freedom of movement. However, since the dynamic model of the soft mobile robot is generally hard to obtain(intractable), it is difficult to design a controller for the robot. In this regard, we present a method to train a controller, using a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called adaptive soft actor-critic (ASAC). ASAC gradually reduces a parameter called an entropy temperature, which regulates the entropy of the control policy. In this way, the proposed method can narrow down the search space during training, and reduce the duration of demanding data collection processes in real-world experiments. For the verification of the robustness and the controllability of our robot and the RL algorithm, experiments for zig-zagging path tracking and obstacle avoidance were conducted, and the robot successfully finished the missions with only an hour of training time.",ar,2020-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,and learning for soft robots | control | hydraulic/pneumatic actuators | Modeling | motion and path planning,2-s2.0-85081104567,,,Article,Kim J.I.,60120123;60120116,Institute of Advanced Machines and Design;Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul;Seoul,South Korea;South Korea,6,"Kim, Jae In;Hong, Mineui;Lee, Kyungjae;Kim, Dongwook;Park, Yong Lae;Oh, Songhwai",57207440216;57215536953;56742456900;57224509911;23009880400;8703374300,60120123;60120116;60120116;60120123;60120123;60120116,April 2020,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,5,2,8978537,2317-2324,0,MOTIE,NRF-2016R1A5A1938472,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy",7,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8978537,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1109/LRA.2020.2970653,Faster confined space manufacturing teleoperation through dynamic autonomy with task dynamics imitation learning,"Confined space manufacturing tasks, such as cleaning pilot holes prior to installing fasteners during aircraft wing assembly, currently require human experts to be inside ergonomically-challenging environments. Small rapidly deployable robots can substantially improve manufacturing safety and productivity. However, relatively rapid full automation remains elusive due to high-level of uncertainty in the environment, lack of cost-effective programming for low volume production, and difficulty of deploying adequate number of sensors in the confined space. Moreover, currently, teleoperation (remote human control of a robot via a force-reflection device) with typical levels of training and limited transparency of hardware is too slow for manufacturing applications, requiring experts to spend more time for each task to achieve the same cleaning quality. In this context, the main contribution of this article is to reduce cycle times for remote manufacturing by learning statistical dynamic autonomy from higher quality expert demonstrations in an ideal offline scenario. During the task, to keep cycle times low, the dynamic autonomy imitates the faster expert demonstrations when certain, and employs the slower human teleoperation when uncertain. A user study (n = 8) with an experimental robot platform shows that for the same cleaning quality, the dynamic autonomy reduces process completion time by 54.0% and human operator energy expenditure by 80.5% as compared with teleoperation without dynamic autonomy.",ar,2020-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,human performance augmentation | Intelligent and flexible manufacturing | learning and adaptive systems | learning from demonstration,2-s2.0-85080895730,,,Article,Owan P.,60015481,University of Washington,Seattle,United States,3,"Owan, Parker;Garbini, Joseph;Devasia, Santosh",55711586900;7004589837;57202492358,60015481;60015481;60015481,April 2020,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,5,2,8976114,2357-2364,0,UW,undefined,Boeing,4,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8976114,,Excluido por machine learning

Handling of giant sheet materials in manufacturing industries is one of the key problems. Utilization of robots, viz SwarmItFIX, will address this problem and automate the fixturing process, which greatly reduces lead time and thus the production cost. Implementation of intelligence into the robots will further improve efficiency in handling and reduce manufacturing inaccuracies. In this work, two different novel planners are proposed which do path planning for the heads of the SwarmItFIX agents. The environment of the problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Problem. The first planner uses the Value Iteration and Policy Iteration (PI) algorithms individually and the second planner performs the Monte Carlo control reinforcement learning. Finally, when the simulation is done and parameters of the proposed three algorithms along with existing Constraint Satisfaction Problem algorithm are compared with each other. It is observed that the proposed PI algorithm returns the plan much faster than the other algorithms. In the near future, the efficient planning model will be tested and implemented into the SwarmItFIX setup at the PMAR laboratory, University of Genoa, Italy.",ar,2020-04-01,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,Monte Carlo control | Multi-head path planning | Policy iteration | Robot fixtureless assembly | SwarmItFIX | Value iteration,2-s2.0-85067803118,,,Article,Veeramani S.,60103672;60025153,Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing Kancheepuram;Università degli Studi di Genova,Chennai;Genoa,India;Italy,4,"Veeramani, Satheeshkumar;Muthuswamy, Sreekumar;Sagar, Keerthi;Zoppi, Matteo",56167487900;57193794139;57192683963;35838978700,60103672;60103672;60025153;60025153,1 April 2020,9565515,24363,15728145,Journal,31,4,,815-832,0,,undefined,Università degli Studi di Genova,2,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10845-019-01479-8,,Excluido por machine learning

NO,10.1109/LRA.2020.2972825,Robust Humanoid Contact Planning with Learned Zero- A nd One-Step Capturability Prediction,"Humanoid robots maintain balance and navigate by controlling the contact wrenches applied to the environment. While it is possible to plan dynamically-feasible motion that applies appropriate wrenches using existing methods, a humanoid may also be affected by external disturbances. Existing systems typically rely on controllers to reactively recover from disturbances. However, such controllers may fail when the robot cannot reach contacts capable of rejecting a given disturbance. In this letter, we propose a search-based footstep planner which aims to maximize the probability of the robot successfully reaching the goal without falling as a result of a disturbance. The planner considers not only the poses of the planned contact sequence, but also alternative contacts near the planned contact sequence that can be used to recover from external disturbances. Although this additional consideration significantly increases the computation load, we train neural networks to efficiently predict multi-contact zero-step and one-step capturability, which allows the planner to generate robust contact sequences efficiently. Our results show that our approach generates footstep sequences that are more robust to external disturbances than a conventional footstep planner in four challenging scenarios.",ar,2020-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,deep learning in robotics and automation | humanoid and bipedal locomotion | Motion and path planning,2-s2.0-85081063619,,,Article,Lin Y.C.,60030569;60025778;60021784,"Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;New York University",Tubingen;Ann Arbor;New York,Germany;United States;United States,3,"Lin, Yu Chi;Righetti, Ludovic;Berenson, Dmitry",57193028338;22981433900;24780413800,60025778;60030569-60021784;60025778,April 2020,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,5,2,8989791,2451-2458,0,ONR,N000141712050,Office of Naval Research,2,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8989791,,Excluido por no educación

NO,10.1109/TCYB.2018.2878977,Robot-Assisted Pedestrian Regulation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Pedestrian regulation can prevent crowd accidents and improve crowd safety in densely populated areas. Recent studies use mobile robots to regulate pedestrian flows for desired collective motion through the effect of passive human-robot interaction (HRI). This paper formulates a robot motion planning problem for the optimization of two merging pedestrian flows moving through a bottleneck exit. To address the challenge of feature representation of complex human motion dynamics under the effect of HRI, we propose using a deep neural network to model the mapping from the image input of pedestrian environments to the output of robot motion decisions. The robot motion planner is trained end-to-end using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which avoids hand-crafted feature detection and extraction, thus improving the learning capability for complex dynamic problems. Our proposed approach is validated in simulated experiments, and its performance is evaluated. The results demonstrate that the robot is able to find optimal motion decisions that maximize the pedestrian outflow in different flow conditions, and the pedestrian-accumulated outflow increases significantly compared to cases without robot regulation and with random robot motion.",ar,2020-04-01,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) | human-robot interaction (HRI) | pedestrian flow regulation,2-s2.0-85057148773,,30475740,Article,Wan Z.,60027392;60014826;60010806,Stevens Institute of Technology;South Dakota State University;University of Rhode Island,Hoboken;Brookings;Kingston,United States;United States;United States,6,"Wan, Zhiqiang;Jiang, Chao;Fahad, Muhammad;Ni, Zhen;Guo, Yi;He, Haibo",57196021321;56422994300;57210222946;38862477100;35205046400;24802077000,60010806;60027392;60027392;60014826;60027392;60010806,April 2020,21682267,21100274221,21682275,Journal,50,4,8540942,1669-1682,0,NSF,1527016,National Science Foundation,14,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8540942,,Excluido por machine learning

In its latest series of “Courses of Study”, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan strongly recommends the use of active learning systems and the introduction of computer programming education courses in elementary schools. Programming instruction typically includes explanations of the basic syntax used in programming languages, the application of that syntax, and related exercises. However, the teachers in programming classes commonly spend much more time correcting errors, that is, debugging their students’ programs, than they spend teaching. These delays can affect the progress of programming lessons and the motivation of the participating students. With these points in mind, we have developed a teaching assistant robot that is designed to support efficient classroom management of programming classes by advising and assisting students who are encountering problems. Herein, we describe the tasks performed by the teaching assistant robot in a classroom environment in which actual programming lessons are assumed to be taught. In particular, we explain the problems encountered by students in the process of learning basic programming techniques, the causes of the problems, the method by which the teaching assistant robot identifies those problems, and the contents of advice provided by the teaching assistant robot corresponding to those problems.

NO,10.3389/frobt.2020.00060,Learning to Avoid Obstacles With Minimal Intervention Control,"Programming by demonstration has received much attention as it offers a general framework which allows robots to efficiently acquire novel motor skills from a human teacher. While traditional imitation learning that only focuses on either Cartesian or joint space might become inappropriate in situations where both spaces are equally important (e.g., writing or striking task), hybrid imitation learning of skills in both Cartesian and joint spaces simultaneously has been studied recently. However, an important issue which often arises in dynamical or unstructured environments is overlooked, namely how can a robot avoid obstacles? In this paper, we aim to address the problem of avoiding obstacles in the context of hybrid imitation learning. Specifically, we propose to tackle three subproblems: (i) designing a proper potential field so as to bypass obstacles, (ii) guaranteeing joint limits are respected when adjusting trajectories in the process of avoiding obstacles, and (iii) determining proper control commands for robots such that potential human-robot interaction is safe. By solving the aforementioned subproblems, the robot is capable of generalizing observed skills to new situations featuring obstacles in a feasible and safe manner. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a toy example as well as a real transportation experiment on the iCub humanoid robot.",ar,2020-05-28,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,humanoid robots | minimal intervention control | obstacle avoidance | programming by demonstration | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85086407531,,,Article,Duan A.,60102151;60025153;60022195;60003771,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia;Università degli Studi di Genova;Massachusetts Institute of Technology;The University of Manchester,Genoa;Genoa;Cambridge;Manchester,Italy;Italy;United States;United Kingdom,7,"Duan, Anqing;Camoriano, Raffaello;Ferigo, Diego;Huang, Yanlong;Calandriello, Daniele;Rosasco, Lorenzo;Pucci, Daniele",57207208557;56085267200;57194087376;54389113100;55737371500;8423888500;55201907900,60102151-60025153;60022195;60102151-60003771;60102151;60022195;60025153-60022195;60102151,28 May 2020,,21100868821,22969144,Journal,7,,60,,1,NSF,DLV-777826,National Science Foundation,0,2020,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2020.00060/full,,Excluido por no educación (programming by demonstration)
NO,10.1145/3392858,C-Reference: Improving 2D to 3D Object Pose Estimation Accuracy via Crowdsourced Joint Object Estimation,"Converting widely-available 2D images and videos, captured using an RGB camera, to 3D can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. However, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). A scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3D object properties. Unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3D properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3D perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder). In this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3D state of a single target object. Our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. We evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3D location estimation by over 40%, while requiring only $35$% as much human time.

Such solutions are necessary in today’s robotics and industry: deprecated old control units render robotic installations useless and allow no upgrades, advancements, or innovation in an inherently innovative ecosystem. For the sake of simplicity, just the first robot axis is considered. The first approach described is a PC solution with data acquisition I/O board (Humusoft MF634). This board is supported with Matlab Real-Time Windows Toolbox for real-time applications and thus whole controller was designed in Matlab environment. The second approach is a robot controller developed on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) board. The complexity of FPGA design can be overcome by using a third party software package, such as self-developed Matlab FPGA Real Time Toolbox. In both cases, parameters of motion controller are calculated by using simulation of the PUMA 560 robot first axis motion.

However, the design of engaging robot-based applications requires the availability of usable, flexible and accessible development frameworks, which can be adopted and mastered by researchers and practitioners in social sciences and adult end users as a whole. This paper surveys Visual Programming Environments aimed at enabling a paradigm fostering the so-called End-User Development of applications involving robots with social capabilities. The focus of this article is on those Visual Programming Environments that are designed to support social research goals as well as to cater for professional needs of people not trained in more traditional text-based computer programming languages. This survey excludes interfaces aimed at supporting expert programmers, at allowing industrial robots to perform typical industrial tasks (such as pick and place operations), and at teaching children how to code. After having performed a systematic search, sixteen programming environments have been included in this survey. Our goal is two-fold: first, to present these software tools with their technical features and Authoring Artificial Intelligence modeling approaches, and second, to present open challenges in the development of Visual Programming Environments for end users and social researchers, which can be informative and valuable to the community. The results show that the most recent such tools are adopting distributed and Component-Based Software Engineering approaches and web technologies. However, few of them have been designed to enable the independence of end users from high-tech scribes. Moreover, findings indicate the need for (i) more objective and comparative evaluations, as well as usability and user experience studies with real end users; and (ii) validations of these tools for designing applications aimed at working “in-the-wild” rather than only in laboratories and structured settings.",ar,2020-06-01,Journal of Computer Languages,End-User Development | Human–robot interaction | Robotics | Social robot | Visual Programming Environment,2-s2.0-85085272330,S2590118420300307,,Article,Coronado E.,60121711;60021361;60004853,"Dipartimento di Informatica, Bioingegneria, Robotica e Ingegneria dei Sistemi;Uniwersytet Jagielloński;Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology",Genoa;Krakow;Fuchu,Italy;Poland;Japan,4,"Coronado, Enrique;Mastrogiovanni, Fulvio;Indurkhya, Bipin;Venture, Gentiane",57188864138;56962745700;6603120668;15623574000,60004853;60121711;60021361;60004853,June 2020,26659182,21100904890,25901184,Journal,58,,100970,,0,,undefined,,19,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2590118420300307?via%3Dihub,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OKR-XyUXpDykC_cBJuEfmkJlYFoxP7oW/view?usp=sharing,

The solution to this problem via stacking decision rules is impossible to cover various environments and sensor properties. Learning-based control methods are adaptive for these scenarios. However, these methods are damaged by low learning efficiency and awkward transferability from simulation to reality. In this paper, we construct a general exploration framework via decomposing the exploration process into the decision, planning, and mapping modules, which increases the modularity of the robotic system. Based on this framework, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based decision algorithm that uses a deep neural network to learning exploration strategy from the partial map. The results show that this proposed algorithm has better learning efficiency and adaptability for unknown environments.

NO,10.1609/aimag.v41i2.5300,Integrated artificial intelligence systems,"From Shakey the Robot to self-driving cars, from the personal computer to personal assistants on our phones, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has led the development of integrated artificial intelligence (AI) systems for more than half a century. From the earliest days of AI, it was apparent that a robust, generally intelligent system should include a complete set of capabilities: perception, memory, reasoning, learning, planning, and action; and when DARPA initiated AI research in the 1960s, ambitious projects such as Shakey the Robot went after the complete package. As DARPA realized the challenges, they backed away from the ultimate goal of integrated AI and tried to make progress on the individual problems of image understanding, speech and language understanding, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning and decision aids, machine learning, and robotic manipulation. Yet, even as researchers struggled to make progress in these subdisciplines, DARPA periodically resurrected the challenge of integrated intelligent systems and pushed the community to try again. In the 1980s, DARPA's Strategic Computing Initiative took on challenges of integrated AI projects such as the Autonomous Land Vehicle and the Pilot's Associate. These did not succeed, but instead set the stage for the several decades of more siloed research that followed, until it was time to try again. In the 2000s, DARPA took on the integrated AI problem again with its Grand Challenges, which led to the first self-driving cars, and projects such as the Personalized Assistant that Learns, which produced Apple's Siri. These efforts created complex, richly-integrated systems that represented quantum leaps ahead in machine intelligence. The integration of sophisticated capabilities in a fundamental way is the key to general intelligence.

The most important feature of our processor is a configurable mixed-signal computing array of vector-by-matrix multiplier (VMM) blocks utilizing embedded nonvolatile memory arrays for storing weight matrices. Analog peripheral circuitry for data conversion and high-voltage programming are shared among a large array of VMM blocks to facilitate compact and energy-efficient analog-domain VMM operation of different types of neural network layers. Other unique features of aCortex include configurable chain of buffers and data buses, simple and efficient instruction set architecture and its corresponding multiagent controller, programmable quantization range, and a customized refresh-free embedded dynamic random access memory. The energy-optimal aCortex with 4-bit analog computing precision was designed in a 55-nm process with embedded NOR flash memory. Its physical performance was evaluated using experimental data from testing individual circuit elements and physical layout of key components for several common benchmarks, namely, Inception-v1 and ResNet-152, two state-of-the-art deep feedforward networks for image classification, and GNTM, Google's deep recurrent network for language translation. The system-level simulation results for these benchmarks show the energy efficiency of 97, 106, and 336 TOp/J, respectively, combined with up to 15 TOp/s computing throughput and 0.27-MB/mm2 storage efficiency.

NO,10.3390/s20123515,A multitasking-oriented robot arm motion planning scheme based on deep reinforcement learning and twin synchro-control,"Humanoid robots are equipped with humanoid arms to make them more acceptable to the general public. Humanoid robots are a great challenge in robotics. The concept of digital twin technology complies with the guiding ideology of not only Industry 4.0, but also Made in China 2025. This paper proposes a scheme that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with digital twin technology for controlling humanoid robot arms. For rapid and stable motion planning for humanoid robots, multitasking-oriented training using the twin synchro-control (TSC) scheme with DRL is proposed. For switching between tasks, the robot arm training must be quick and diverse. In this work, an approach for obtaining a priori knowledge as input to DRL is developed and verified using simulations. Two simple examples are developed in a simulation environment. We developed a data acquisition system to generate angle data efficiently and automatically. These data are used to improve the reward function of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and quickly train the robot for a task. The approach is applied to a model of the humanoid robot BHR-6, a humanoid robot with multiple-motion mode and a sophisticated mechanical structure. Using the policies trained in the simulations, the humanoid robot can perform tasks that are not possible to train with existing methods. The training is fast and allows the robot to perform multiple tasks. Our approach utilizes human joint angle data collected by the data acquisition system to solve the problem of a sparse reward in DRL for two simple tasks. A comparison with simulation results for controllers trained using the vanilla DDPG show that the designed controller developed using the DDPG with the TSC scheme have great advantages in terms of learning stability and convergence speed.",ar,2020-06-01,Sensors (Switzerland),Deep reinforcement learning | Humanoid robot | Twin synchro-control,2-s2.0-85086760300,,32575907,Article,Liu C.,60016835;116582561,Beijing Institute of Technology;Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Intelligent Robots and Systems,Beijing;Beijing,China;China,5,"Liu, Chuzhao;Gao, Junyao;Bi, Yuanzhen;Shi, Xuanyang;Tian, Dingkui",57188974986;24447900900;57217210782;57072116800;57214144889,60016835-116582561;60016835-116582561;60016835-116582561;60016835-116582561;60016835-116582561,June 2020,14248220,130124,,Journal,20,12,3515,1-35,1,DARPA,B2220132014,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,7,2020,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/12/3515,,Excluido por machine learning

Thus, there has been an increasing interest in robotic systems as they are robust and cost-effective in comparison to conventional physical motor-therapy with a therapist. These robots have applications in therapeutic and in-home environments, where there is a necessity for a user-friendly procedure to program the robots for a specific task easily. Our group has suggested robot learning from demonstration (LfD) as an intuitive procedure to program robots via short-term physical interaction in rehabilitation and assistive applications. In this article, a therapist assists a patient, and cooperatively performs a task on a robotic manipulator. Then, using a nonparametric potential field function, the therapist's motion, and interaction force (assistance/resistance) is modeled time-independently via a convex optimization algorithm. Next, in the therapist's absence, the robot provides the patient with the same level of interaction force provided by the therapist along the trajectory. A velocity field controller is also designed to compensate and regulate the patient's deviation from the velocity observed in the demonstration phase. Finally, the efficacy, advantages, and stability of the proposed framework are evaluated in three different experimental scenarios involving spring arrays and an individual with cerebral palsy (CP).",ar,2020-06-01,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,Assistive technology | human-robot interaction | motion control | rehabilitation robotics | robot learning,2-s2.0-85086999089,,,Article,Najafi M.,60030835;60002146,University of Alberta;Ontario Tech University,Edmonton;Oshawa,Canada;Canada,4,"Najafi, Mohammad;Rossa, Carlos;Adams, Kim;Tavakoli, Mahdi",57212542175;57193396327;12902675100;8668966400,60030835;60002146;60030835;60030835,June 2020,10834435,19113,1941014X,Journal,25,3,9040645,1622-1633,0,CIHR,LOF 28241,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,2,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9040645,,Excluido por nada que ver (health care)
NO,10.1002/rob.21931,Autonomous aerial cinematography in unstructured environments with learned artistic decision-making,"Aerial cinematography is revolutionizing industries that require live and dynamic camera viewpoints such as entertainment, sports, and security. However, safely piloting a drone while filming a moving target in the presence of obstacles is immensely taxing, often requiring multiple expert human operators. Hence, there is a demand for an autonomous cinematographer that can reason about both geometry and scene context in real-time. Existing approaches do not address all aspects of this problem; they either require high-precision motion-capture systems or global positioning system tags to localize targets, rely on prior maps of the environment, plan for short time horizons, or only follow fixed artistic guidelines specified before the flight. In this study, we address the problem in its entirety and propose a complete system for real-time aerial cinematography that for the first time combines: (a) vision-based target estimation; (b) 3D signed-distance mapping for occlusion estimation; (c) efficient trajectory optimization for long time-horizon camera motion; and (d) learning-based artistic shot selection. We extensively evaluate our system both in simulation and in field experiments by filming dynamic targets moving through unstructured environments. Our results indicate that our system can operate reliably in the real world without restrictive assumptions.

NO,10.1007/s13218-020-00652-z,Just-In-Time Constraint-Based Inference for Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning,"We discuss a research roadmap for going beyond the state of the art in qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning (QSTR). Simply put, QSTR is a major field of study in Artificial Intelligence that abstracts from numerical quantities of space and time by using qualitative descriptions instead (e.g., precedes, contains, is left of); thus, it provides a concise framework that allows for rather inexpensive reasoning about entities located in space or time. Applications of QSTR can be found in a plethora of areas and domains such as smart environments, intelligent vehicles, and unmanned aircraft systems. Our discussion involves researching novel local consistencies in the aforementioned discipline, defining dynamic algorithms pertaining to these consistencies that can allow for efficient reasoning over changing spatio-temporal information, and leveraging the structures of the locally consistent related problems with regard to novel decomposability and theoretical tractability properties. Ultimately, we argue for pushing the envelope in QSTR via defining tools for tackling dynamic variants of the fundamental reasoning problems in this discipline, i.e., problems stated in terms of changing input data. Indeed, time is a continuous flow and spatial objects can change (e.g., in shape, size, or structure) as time passes; therefore, it is pertinent to be able to efficiently reason about dynamic spatio-temporal data. Finally, these tools are to be integrated into the larger context of highly active areas such as neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning, planning, data mining, and robotic applications. Our final goal is to inspire further discussion in the community about constraint-based QSTR in general, and the possible lines of future research that we outline here in particular.",ar,2020-06-01,KI - Kunstliche Intelligenz,Adaptivity | Decomposability | Dynamic algorithms | Just-in-time inference | Local consistencies | Parallelization | Qualitative constraints | Singleton checks | Spatio-temporal reasoning,2-s2.0-85088024634,,,Article,Sioutis M.,60011372,Universität Bamberg,Bamberg,Germany,1,"Sioutis, Michael",55352567900,60011372,1 June 2020,9331875,21101017166,16101987,Journal,34,2,,259-270,1,,undefined,,3,2020,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13218-020-00652-z,,Excluido por AI
SI,10.1145/3386329,History of Logo,"Logo is more than a programming language. It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first computer language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN). Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables. Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in the Logo language development as it encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.",ar,2020-06-12,Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages,Computing education - Computational thinking | Computing education programs - Computer science education | Computing literacy | Constructionism | Constructivism | Data types and structures | Education - Interactive learning environments | Functional languages | Functions and subroutines | History of computing - History of programming languages | Imperative languages | Informal education | Interactive computation | K-12 education (ages 5-18) | Language features - Control structures | Lisp | Logo | Procedures | Recursion | Recursion | Recursive functions | Software notations and tools - General programming languages | Theory of computation - Models of computation - Computability - Lambda calculus | Turtle geometry,2-s2.0-85091286885,,,Article,Solomon C.,60107184;60026851;60025038;60006320;125143363;108659029,"NYU Shanghai;University of Oxford;University of California, Berkeley;MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory;Cynthia Solomon Consulting;Playful Invention Company",Shanghai;Oxford;Berkeley;Cambridge;Somerville;Montreal,China;United Kingdom;United States;United States;United States;Canada,8,"Solomon, Cynthia;Harvey, Brian;Kahn, Ken;Lieberman, Henry;Miller, Mark L.;Minsky, Margaret;Papert, Artemis;Silverman, Brian",57219109223;36454637900;55399222500;7101773938;57225871617;57219108055;57219110192;57196757574,125143363;60025038;60026851;60006320;;60107184;;108659029,12 June 2020,,21101020042,24751421,Journal,4,HOPL,79,,1,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation,9,2020,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3386329,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIN7TLEX8YKmYKSi6Lqd1WK5B8msD8LQ/view?usp=sharing,

In this paper, we develop a new method to alleviate these problems based on deep Q-learning with experience replay and heuristic knowledge. In this method, a neural network has been used to resolve the curse of dimensionality issue of the Q-table in reinforcement learning. When a robot is walking in an unknown environment, it collects experience data which is used for training a neural network such a process is called experience replay. Heuristic knowledge helps the robot avoid blind exploration and provides more effective data for training the neural network.

In this paper, we introduce techniques to learn higher-order programs. Specifically, we extend meta-interpretive learning (MIL) to support learning higher-order programs by allowing for higher-order definitions to be used as background knowledge. Our theoretical results show that learning higher-order programs, rather than first-order programs, can reduce the textual complexity required to express programs, which in turn reduces the size of the hypothesis space and sample complexity. We implement our idea in two new MIL systems: the Prolog system Metagol ho and the ASP system HEXMIL ho. Both systems support learning higher-order programs and higher-order predicate invention, such as inventing functions for map/3 and conditions for filter/3. We conduct experiments on four domains (robot strategies, chess playing, list transformations, and string decryption) that compare learning first-order and higher-order programs.

To fully leverage their potential, a key challenge is planning missions for efficient data acquisition in complex environments. To address this issue, this article introduces a general informative path planning framework for monitoring scenarios using an aerial robot, focusing on problems in which the value of sensor information is unevenly distributed in a target area and unknown a priori. The approach is capable of learning and focusing on regions of interest via adaptation to map either discrete or continuous variables on the terrain using variable-resolution data received from probabilistic sensors. During a mission, the terrain maps built online are used to plan information-rich trajectories in continuous 3-D space by optimizing initial solutions obtained by a coarse grid search. Extensive simulations show that our approach is more efficient than existing methods.

NO,10.1016/j.future.2020.03.021,Smishing Detector: A security model to detect smishing through SMS content analysis and URL behavior analysis,"Smartphone's popularity and their constant connectivity to the World Wide Web have made these devices vulnerable to phishing and smishing attacks. Phishing is a practice of sending malicious emails to users. Smishing is a combined form of SMS and Phishing in which invaders send SMS containing malicious content to the victim. This content sometimes includes links which redirect the user to websites containing malicious applications and user interfaces. Researchers have proposed various methods in past years to detect smishing but still, we lack a method that significantly avoids false-positive results i.e. falsely categorizing a message as malicious when it is genuine. Hence, we have proposed a model called ’Smishing Detector’ to identify smishing messages while reducing false-positive results at every possible step. The proposed method consists of four modules, namely, SMS Content Analyzer, URL Filter, Source Code Analyzer and Apk Download Detector. SMS Content Analyzer analyzes the text message contents. Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm is used to identify the malicious contents and keywords present in the text message. URL Filter inspects the URL to identify malicious features. Source Code Analyzer examines the source code of the website to identify the harmful code embedded in it. Form tag and URL domain present in the source code are also inspected in this module. APK Download Detector identifies whether any malicious file is downloaded while invoking the URL. User consent taken while downloading the file is also inspected in this module. Finally, we have developed a prototype of the proposed system which has been validated with experiments on SMS datasets. In this paper, we have demonstrated the results of each module separately and also we have demonstrated the final results. The results of the experiments show an overall accuracy of 96.29%. We have compared this model with other models proposed by various researchers and we have found that this model covers more security aspects as compared to other models.",ar,2020-07-01,Future Generation Computer Systems,Machine learning | Mobile security | Phishing | Smishing | SMS | Text messaging,2-s2.0-85082016665,S0167739X19318758,,Article,Mishra S.,60080305,Jaypee Institute of Information Technology,Noida,India,2,"Mishra, Sandhya;Soni, Devpriya",57211276499;56439262300,60080305;60080305,July 2020,0167739X,12264,,Journal,108,,,803-815,0,,undefined,,12,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X19318758?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por nada que ver (security)

It is much efficient to leave that part to the machine autonomy. In order to combine the intention and planning ability of users with robotic control, the shared control is introduced in which users’ inputs and robot control methods are combined to achieve a goal. The shared control problem can be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. To find the optimal control policy, we adopt an adaptive dynamic programming and reinforcement learning-based control algorithm-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient combined with Hindsight Experience Replay.

NO,10.1007/s10514-020-09922-z,Exploration of the applicability of probabilistic inference for learning control in underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles,"Underwater vehicles are employed in the exploration of dynamic environments where tuning of a specific controller for each task would be time-consuming and unreliable as the controller depends on calculated mathematical coefficients in idealised conditions. For such a case, learning task from experience can be a useful alternative. This paper explores the capability of probabilistic inference learning to control autonomous underwater vehicles that can be used for different tasks without re-programming the controller. Probabilistic inference learning uses a Gaussian process model of the real vehicle to learn the correct policy with a small number of real field experiments. The use of probabilistic reinforcement learning looks for a simple implementation of controllers without the burden of coefficients calculation, controller tuning or system identification. A series of computational simulations were employed to test the applicability of model-based reinforcement learning in underwater vehicles. Three simulation scenarios were evaluated: waypoint tracking, depth control and 3D path tracking control. The 3D path tracking is done by coupling together a line-of-sight law with probabilistic inference for learning control. As a comparison study LOS-PILCO algorithm can perform better than a robust LOS-PID. The results show that probabilistic model-based reinforcement learning can be a deployable solution to motion control of underactuated AUVs as it can generate capable policies with minimum quantity of episodes.",ar,2020-07-01,Autonomous Robots,LOS | Path tracking | PILCO | Reinforcement learning | Underwater vehicle,2-s2.0-85087047848,,,Article,Ariza Ramirez W.,60007015,Australian Maritime College,Launceston,Australia,4,"Ariza Ramirez, Wilmer;Leong, Zhi Quan;Nguyen, Hung Duc;Jayasinghe, Shantha Gamini",57210587584;56349242300;56071426700;35793741000,60007015;60007015;60007015;60007015,1 July 2020,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,44,6,,1121-1134,0,DST,undefined,Defence Science and Technology Group,3,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10514-020-09922-z,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.3390/s20143871,A novel statistical method for scene classification based on multi-object categorization and logistic regression,"In recent years, interest in scene classification of different indoor-outdoor scene images has increased due to major developments in visual sensor techniques. Scene classification has been demonstrated to be an efficient method for environmental observations but it is a challenging task considering the complexity of multiple objects in scenery images. These images include a combination of different properties and objects i.e., (color, text, and regions) and they are classified on the basis of optimal features. In this paper, an efficient multiclass objects categorization method is proposed for the indoor-outdoor scene classification of scenery images using benchmark datasets. We illustrate two improved methods, fuzzy c-mean and mean shift algorithms, which infer multiple object segmentation in complex images. Multiple object categorization is achieved through multiple kernel learning (MKL), which considers local descriptors and signatures of regions. The relations between multiple objects are then examined by intersection over union algorithm. Finally, scene classification is achieved by using Multi-class Logistic Regression (McLR). Experimental evaluation demonstrated that our scene classification method is superior compared to other conventional methods, especially when dealing with complex images.

NO,10.1007/s12555-019-0497-3,Human-swarm Interactions for Formation Control Using Interpreters,"In this work, we develop a novel Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI) framework for formation control using the notion of an interpreter, enabling the user to control a robotic swarm's shape and formation using abstraction. The user conveys their intended commands by drawing shapes through arm gestures and motions which are recorded by an off-the-shelf wearable device. We propose a novel interpreter system, which acts as an intermediary between the user and the swarm to simplify the roles of both. The interpreter takes in high level input in the form of shapes drawn by the user, and translates it into swarm control commands by planning in the shape space using novel shape morphing dynamics (SMD), which is also used for user feedback. The proposed interpreter employs machine learning, estimation and optimal control techniques to translate the users intention into swarm control parameters. The dynamics of the swarm are realized by means of a novel decentralized formation controller based on distributed linear iterations and dynamic average consensus. Theoretical guarantees of convergence along with convergence rate of the proposed swarm controller are given. The resulting shape morphing dynamics are illustrated and discussed through simulations.

NO,10.1109/TRO.2020.2974094,Learning-Based Proxy Collision Detection for Robot Motion Planning Applications,"This article demonstrates that collision detection-intensive applications such as robotic motion planning may be accelerated by performing collision checks with a machine learning model. We propose Fastron, a learning-based algorithm, to model a robot's configuration space to be used as a proxy collision detector in place of standard geometric collision checkers. We demonstrate that leveraging the proxy collision detector results in up to an order of magnitude faster performance in robot simulation and planning than state-of-the-art collision detection libraries. Our results show that Fastron learns a model more than 100 times faster than a competing C-space modeling approach, while also providing theoretical guarantees of learning convergence. Using the open motion planning libraries (OMPLs), we were able to generate initial motion plans across all experiments with varying robot and environment complexities and workspace obstacle locations.

NO,10.1007/s10956-020-09833-9,Mining Effective Learning Behaviors in a Web-Based Inquiry Science Environment,"Analyzing learners’ learning behaviors helps teachers understand how learning behaviors of learners influence learning performance. To determine which learning behaviors influence learners’ science-based inquiry learning performance, this work develops an xAPI (Experience Application Programming Interface)-based learning record store module embedded in a Collaborative Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (CWISE) to record detailed data about students’ learning processes. This work discusses whether the significant correlation and cause-effect relationship among science inquiry competence, learning time, and learning performance exist, and examines whether remarkable shifts and differences in the learning behaviors of learners with different learning performances and inquiry competences exist by using sequential pattern mining and lag sequential analysis. The results demonstrate that inquire ability, total learning time in the designed inquiry learning course, and learning time in an inquiry buoyancy simulation experiment are positively correlated with learning performance and can predict learning performance, and the learning time in the inquiry buoyancy simulation experiment appears to be the most significant predictor. The results of lag sequential analyses indicate that learners with high learning performance and high inquiry competence re-adjust hypotheses after performing an inquiry buoyancy simulation experiment, while learners with low learning performance and low inquiry competence lack this critical inquiry learning behavior. This study presents a systematic analysis method to insight the effective learning behaviors in a web-based inquiry learning environment based on mining students’ learning processes, thus providing potential benefits in guiding learners to adjust their learning behaviors and strategies.",ar,2020-08-01,Journal of Science Education and Technology,Data mining | Lag sequential analysis | Learning process analysis | Sequential pattern mining | Web-based inquiry learning | xAPI,2-s2.0-85084643991,,,Article,Chen C.M.,60027018,National Chengchi University,Taipei,Taiwan,2,"Chen, Chih Ming;Wang, Wen Fang",56716947400;57188960839,60027018;60027018,1 August 2020,10590145,23646,15731839,Journal,29,4,,519-535,0,,undefined,,3,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10956-020-09833-9,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

A continuous trajectory planning methodology for serial manipulators based on non-convex global optimization is presented in this paper. First, a kinematic trajectory planning model based on non-convex optimization is constructed to balance motion rapidity and safety. Then, a model transformation method for the non-convex optimization model is presented. In this way, the accurate global solution can be obtained with an iterative solver starting from arbitrary initializations, which can greatly improve the computational accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, an efficient initialization method for the iterative solver based on multivariable-multiple regression is presented, which further speeds up the solution process. The results show that trajectory planning efficiency is significantly enhanced by model transformation and initialization improvement for the iterative solver. Consequently, real-time continuous trajectory planning for serial manipulators with many degrees of freedom can be achieved, which lays a basis for performing dynamic tasks in complex environments.",ar,2020-08-01,Applied Mathematical Modelling,Global optimization | Machine learning | Non-convex optimization | Real-time trajectory planning | Robotics,2-s2.0-85083184469,S0307904X2030130X,,Article,Zhang S.,60023256;60013789,Politecnico di Milano;Beihang University,Milan;Beijing,Italy;China,4,"Zhang, Shiyu;Dai, Shuling;Zanchettin, Andrea Maria;Villa, Renzo",57200408462;7203008798;27268100300;57209134121,60013789;60013789;60023256;60023256,August 2020,0307904X,28065,,Journal,84,,,89-105,0,,undefined,,6,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0307904X2030130X?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

The project is equipped with a robotic arm that serves to select, capture, and locate nylon elements of different colors and shapes, placing them in different classification trays; it will also be visualized on a graphic interface through a monitor. Elements such as the Arduino data processing card, a 1920×1080 pixel HD camera to improve the visualization of the shapes and color of the element and a conveyor belt that will allow the movement of the elements have been used. Using the images obtained by the camera and processed in binary form in the Arduino, an automated control of the robotic arm that allows controlled movement and proper positioning in the corresponding sorting tray is obtained. The processing of the images uses a specific programming to make the edge detection and to obtain the points of the image that belongs to the border of the desired figure. Due to the imperfections of the image a process of filters in the image is followed as the scaling, the dilation of the image that allows suppressing the background of the figure and finally the erosion that helps to join or to obtain an outline to the desired shape.

NO,10.1109/JIOT.2020.3004339,AirScope: Mobile Robots-Assisted Cooperative Indoor Air Quality Sensing by Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Indoor air pollution has become a growing health risk, but it is challenging to provide low-cost air quality monitoring for the indoor environment. In this article, we present 'AirScope,' a mobile sensing system that employs cooperative robots to monitor the indoor air quality. Since the wireless coverage can be incomplete in some indoor areas, AirScope allows the robots to defer uploading the data to the central server by utilizing their own data buffers. In order to guarantee the timeliness of the data in the server, AirScope aims to minimize the average data latency by properly planning the routes of the robots. Such a route planning strategy has to be implemented in a distributed way since the robots that are out of wireless coverage can only make plans on their own. In addition, the cooperation of the robots is also necessary because the aggregation of the robots in a small area increases the average data latency of the other unattended areas. To solve this distributed and cooperative routing planning problem, we propose a solution based on distributed deep $Q$ -learning (DDQL). We evaluate the system performance by simulations and real-world experiments. The results show that AirScope is effective to reduce data latency, where the proposed DDQL is 8% better than the greedy algorithm and 24% better than the random strategy.",ar,2020-09-01,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Intelligent robots | Internet of Things | learning management systems | smart homes,2-s2.0-85092128779,,,Article,Hu Z.,60014966;125193383,Peking University;Tiankuo Song Is with Beijing 101 Middle School,Beijing;Beijing,China;China,5,"Hu, Zhiwen;Cong, Shuchang;Song, Tiankuo;Bian, Kaigui;Song, Lingyang",56890031400;57219319827;57217482105;55339892600;55585880400,60014966;60014966;125193383;60014966;60014966,September 2020,,21100338350,23274662,Journal,7,9,9123492,9189-9200,0,,61625101,,2,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9123492,,Excluido por machine learning

Owing to the high dimensionality of robotic hands and intermittent contact dynamics, effectively programming a robotic hand for in-hand manipulations is still a challenging problem. To address this challenge, this work employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to learn in-hand manipulations for multi-fingered robotic hands. A reward-shaping method is proposed to assist the learning of in-hand manipulation. The synergy of robotic hand postures is analysed to build a low-dimensional hand posture space. Two additional rewards are designed based on both the analysis of hand synergies and its learning history. The two additional rewards cooperating with an extrinsic reward are used to assist the in-hand manipulation learning. Three value functions are trained jointly with respect to their reward functions. Then they cooperate to optimise a control policy for in-hand manipulation. The reward shaping not only improves the exploration efficiency of the DRL algorithm but also provides a way to incorporate domain knowledge. The performance of the proposed learning method is evaluated with object rotation tasks.

The authors share their practical experiences designing autonomous vehicle systems. These systems are complex, consisting of three major subsystems: (1) algorithms for localization, perception, and planning and control; (2) client systems, such as the robotics operating system and hardware platform; and (3) the cloud platform, which includes data storage, simulation, high-definition (HD) mapping, and deep learning model training. The algorithm subsystem extracts meaningful information from sensor raw data to understand its environment and make decisions as to its future actions. The client subsystem integrates these algorithms to meet real-time and reliability requirements. The cloud platform provides offline computing and storage capabilities for autonomous vehicles. Using the cloud platform, new algorithms can be tested so as to update the HD map-in addition to training better recognition, tracking, and decision models. Since the first edition of this book was released, many universities have adopted it in their autonomous driving classes, and the authors received many helpful comments and feedback from readers. Based on this, the second edition was improved by extending and rewriting multiple chapters and adding two commercial test case studies. In addition, a new section entitled “Teaching and Learning from this Book” was added to help instructors better utilize this book in their classes. The second edition captures the latest advances in autonomous driving and that it also presents usable real-world case studies to help readers better understand how to utilize their lessons in commercial autonomous driving projects. This book should be useful to students, researchers, and practitioners alike. Whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student interested in autonomous driving, you will find herein a comprehensive overview of the whole autonomous vehicle technology stack.

A contrary point of view argues that machine learning has limitations, and, taken in isolation, cannot form the basis of autonomous systems capable of intelligent behaviour in complex environments. In this paper, we explore the contributions that agent-oriented programming can make to the development of future intelligent systems. We briefly review the state of the art in agent programming, focussing particularly on BDI-based agent programming languages, and discuss previous work on integrating AI techniques (including machine learning) in agent-oriented programming. We argue that the unique strengths of BDI agent languages provide an ideal framework for integrating the wide range of AI capabilities necessary for progress towards the next-generation of intelligent systems. We identify a range of possible approaches to integrating AI into a BDI agent architecture. Some of these approaches, e.g., ‘AI as a service’, exploit immediate synergies between rapidly maturing AI techniques and agent programming, while others, e.g., ‘AI embedded into agents’ raise more fundamental research questions, and we sketch a programme of research directed towards identifying the most appropriate ways of integrating AI capabilities into agent programs.",ar,2020-10-01,Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,Agent programming languages | Artificial intelligence | Belief-desire-intention | Machine learning,2-s2.0-85086699581,,,Article,Bordini R.H.,60015760;60015138;60008734;60001422;60000686,"Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul;University of Nottingham;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam;Sorbonne Universite;Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna, Cesena",Porto Alegre;Nottingham;Amsterdam;Paris;Cesena,Brazil;United Kingdom;Netherlands;France;Italy,5,"Bordini, Rafael H.;El Fallah Seghrouchni, Amal;Hindriks, Koen;Logan, Brian;Ricci, Alessandro",57203102955;6603487525;55904124900;56092567900;7202337846,60015760;60001422;60008734;60015138;60000686,1 October 2020,13872532,24157,15737454,Journal,34,2,37,,1,CAPES,undefined,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior,10,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10458-020-09453-y,,Excluido por machine learning

In the presence of dynamic obstacles, traditional solutions usually employ re-planning strategies, which re-call a planning algorithm to search for an alternative path whenever the robot encounters a conflict. However, such re-planning strategies often cause unnecessary detours. To address this issue, we propose a learning-based technique that exploits environmental spatio-temporal information. Different from existing learning-based methods, we introduce a globally guided reinforcement learning approach (G2RL), which incorporates a novel reward structure that generalizes to arbitrary environments. We apply G2RL to solve the multi-robot path planning problem in a fully distributed reactive manner. We evaluate our method across different map types, obstacle densities, and the number of robots.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2020.3006797,Building Energy-Cost Maps from Aerial Images and Ground Robot Measurements with Semi-Supervised Deep Learning,"Planning energy-efficient paths is an important capability in many robotics applications. Obtaining an energy-cost map for a given environment enables planning such paths between any given pair of locations within the environment. However, efficiently building an energy map is challenging, especially for large environments. Some of the prior work uses physics-based laws (friction and gravity force) to model energy costs across environments. These methods work well for uniform surfaces, but they do not generalize well to uneven terrains. In this letter, we present a method to address this mapping problem in a data-driven fashion for the cases where an aerial image of the environment can be obtained.

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2020.103604,Collective navigation of a multi-robot system in an unknown environment,"The navigation of autonomous, mobile multi-robot systems in changing environments is a challenging problem investigated over the past years. Cooperative, multiple robots are employed for many different tasks to increase the efficiency and success of a mission. However, many of the existing collective path planning approaches do not guarantee a reliable escape in environments with complex, non-convex obstacles without any prior knowledge. In this study, we developed a navigation framework for multi-robot systems in unknown areas that solely exploit the sensing information and shared data among the agents. The key contribution of this paper is the simultaneous, collision-free motion planning for fully autonomous robots in a collective manner. Furthermore, our communication architecture enables the robots to find an appropriate path to a desired, joint target position, despite the limited sensing and communication range.",ar,2020-10-01,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,Autonomous systems | Collective navigation | Cooperative control | Swarm intelligence,2-s2.0-85088835141,S0921889020304449,,Article,Olcay E.,60019722,Technical University of Munich,Munich,Germany,3,"Olcay, Ertug;Schuhmann, Fabian;Lohmann, Boris",57203762906;57347731400;7006359036,60019722;60019722;60019722,October 2020,9218890,18079,,Journal,132,,103604,,0,DFG,SFB 768,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,7,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889020304449?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1007/s10846-020-01196-y,A Global/Local Path Planner for Multi-Robot Systems with Uncertain Robot Localization,"This paper proposes a path planner for multi-robot systems based on the solution of the multiple traveling salesman problem by genetic algorithm. The main planning goal is to build an efficient path to each robot of the system which jointly ensures that several a priori known points (ways-points) in the environment can be attained by at least one of the robots. During navigation, each robot try to follow its planned path while performing tasks and deviating from unknown static and dynamic obstacles. As the robots have limited sensing and communication skills, their positions can easily become uncertain and the robots will be unable to follow their planned paths. To circumvent this problem, each robot has a local planner, able to recalculate its position and then to resume its planned path. This computation is based on the knowledge about way-points positions, information exchanged with other robots and a self localization algorithm by triangulation. The proposed global/local path planner is firstly validated by computer simulations. An experimental study is also carried out with a small system with very simple mobile robots with differential drive and Bluetooth communication. The obtained results confirm the efficacy of the proposed path planner.",ar,2020-10-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,Genetic algorithm | Multi-robot systems | Multiple traveling salesmen problem | Path planning,2-s2.0-85084044628,,,Article,de Almeida J.P.L.S.,60257059;60027294,Instituto Federal do Paraná;Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná,Curitiba;Curitiba,Brazil;Brazil,4,"de Almeida, João Paulo Lima Silva;Nakashima, Renan Taizo;Neves-Jr, Flávio;de Arruda, Lúcia Valéria Ramos",55609217900;57204723468;7004435369;57211294171,60257059-60027294;60027294;60027294;60027294,1 October 2020,9210296,24360,15730409,Journal,100,1,,311-333,0,CNPq,305816/2014-4,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,1,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10846-020-01196-y,,Excluido por no educación (path planning)
NO,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2020.102418,One-Shot kinesthetic programming by demonstration for soft collaborative robots,"Robots have long been part of production lines and, since they are widely used in a variety of applications, they have become a mass product. Yet, their integration into production is costly due to the necessity of skilled engineers programming them. The goal of this article is to reduce these costs via a programming by demonstration approach, allowing unskilled workers to complete the task of said engineers. Rather than just working next to a robot, this enables a collaborative work environment where humans use manipulators as tools for various tasks. This work aims at automatically generating a trajectory by a single kinesthetic demonstration, which is performed by a non-expert user. The proposed approach adapts and extends the trajectory generator of a previous work and develops a method that gives guarantees on the deviation between the demonstrated path and the generated path. In contrast to the previous work, an expert user is not required. Furthermore, instead of teaching a series of points the whole trajectory is recorded in a single demonstration. To ensure real-time compatibility on the target hardware, one focus of this paper is on the complexity of the algorithm. The method is validated using a soft quasi continuum manipulator as an example for a collaborative robot.",ar,2020-10-01,Mechatronics,Collaborative robots | Continuum manipulators | Human machine interaction | Programming by demonstration | Soft robots,2-s2.0-85089815882,S0957415820300945,,Article,Müller D.,60015815,Universität Stuttgart,Stuttgart,Germany,4,"Müller, Daniel;Veil, Carina;Seidel, Marc;Sawodny, Oliver",57193742694;57218622418;57218616460;6603314950,60015815;60015815;60015815;60015815,October 2020,9574158,21096,,Journal,70,,102418,,0,DFG,SA 847/20-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,3,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957415820300945?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1109/TASE.2020.2974771,Planning Jerk-Optimized Trajectory with Discrete Time Constraints for Redundant Robots,"We present a method for effectively planning the motion trajectory of robots in manufacturing tasks, the tool paths of which are usually complex and have a large number of discrete time constraints as waypoints. Kinematic redundancy also exists in these robotic systems. The jerk of motion is optimized in our trajectory planning method at the meanwhile of fabrication process to improve the quality of fabrication. Our method is based on a sampling strategy and consists of two major parts. After determining an initial path by graph search, a greedy algorithm is adopted to optimize a path by locally applying adaptive filers in the regions with large jerks. The filtered result is obtained by numerical optimization. In order to achieve efficient computation, an adaptive sampling method is developed for learning a collision-indication function that is represented as a support-vector machine. Applications in robot-Assisted 3-D printing are given in this article to demonstrate the functionality of our approach. Note to Practitioners-In robot-Assisted manufacturing applications, robotic arms are employed to realize the motion of workpieces (or machining tools) specified as a sequence of waypoints with the positions of tool tip and the tool orientations constrained. The required degree of freedom (DOF) is often less than the robotic hardware system (e.g., a robotic arm has six-DOF). Specifically, rotations of the workpiece around the axis of a tool can be arbitrary (see Fig. 1 for an example). By using this redundancy, i.e., there are many possible poses of a robotic arm to realize a given waypoint, the trajectory of robots can be optimized to consider the performance of motion in velocity, acceleration, and jerk in the joint space. In addition, when fabricating complex models, each tool path can have a large amount of waypoints. It is crucial for a motion planning algorithm to compute a smooth and collision-free trajectory of robot to improve the fabrication quality. The time taken by the planning algorithm should not significantly lengthen the total manufacturing time; ideally, it would remain hidden as computing motions for a layer can be done while the previous layer is printing. The method presented in this article provides an efficient framework to tackle this problem. The framework has been well tested on our robot-Assisted additive manufacturing system to demonstrate its effectiveness and can be generally applied to other robot-Assisted manufacturing systems.",ar,2020-10-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Discrete time constraints | kinematic redundancy | robotic fabrication | trajectory planning,2-s2.0-85092189608,,,Article,Dai C.,60118055;60013373;60008928;60002798,"The Department of Design Engineering, TU Delft;INRIA Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique;Hong Kong Polytechnic University;Chinese University of Hong Kong",Delft;Le Chesnay;Kowloon;Hong Kong,Netherlands;France;Hong Kong;Hong Kong,5,"Dai, Chengkai;Lefebvre, Sylvain;Yu, Kai Ming;Geraedts, Jo M.P.;Wang, Charlie C.L.",57141612100;24779875700;7403385430;55210693700;35231427200,60118055-60002798;60013373;60008928;60118055;60002798,October 2020,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,17,4,9025760,1711-1724,0,NSFC,CUHK/14202219,National Natural Science Foundation of China,9,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9025760,,Excluido por machine learning

However, one of the biggest challenges of PbD is the recognition of demonstrator's finger high-fidelity motions especially in the environments with uncertainties, which limits the efficiency and accuracy of PbD. In this article, inspired by human dexterity, a novel PbD approach using the implicit muscular task planning strategy is presented to extract features from the arms' giant movement and the hands' fine motions during the demonstrator's operation. Furthermore, we integrate a deep reinforcement learning control method that further improves the manipulations' adaptive ability in the unknown or dynamic environments.

NO,10.1007/s11265-020-01522-5,An FPGA-Based Accelerated Optimization Algorithm for Real-Time Applications,"Many modern applications, such as industrial control, image processing and machine learning, are based on optimization algorithms that must solve compute-intensive problems under real-time constraints taking into account real-world parameters that evolve in time. Among others, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly used in real-time applications to solve such complex optimization problems. Moreover, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been proved an effective platform for the implementation of these algorithms satisfying real-time and low-power requirements. In this paper, we study the FPGA-based acceleration of the Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC) algorithm. BB-BC is an optimization method inspired by the corresponding evolutionary theory of the universe [1]. The BB-BC method is performed in two phases: in the Bing Bang phase, similarly to other Genetic Algorithms (GAs) it generates a random population of candidate solutions, while in the Big Crunch phase it shrinks these candidates around an optimal point. It has been shown that the BB-BC method outperforms classical GA algorithms for several optimization problems in terms of convergence speed. We show that the BB-BC algorithm does not suffer from the design limitations of the classical GAs that impede the performance of their hardware-based accelerators. We propose an efficient fully pipelined design of both BB-BC phases and a parallel scheme which integrates several BB-BC pipelined engines to improve system performance. We implement the proposed FPGA-based accelerator on a Xilinx Virtex-5 development board for three different fitness functions and compare the execution time against its software counterpart (in C language) and a CUDA program running on a massively parallel computing platform (GPU). We also compare the proposed optimized FPGA architecture with an RTL design generated by a high-level synthesis (HLS) design flow. We propose an Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model for fitness function approximation method to reduce the execution latency of complex fitness functions. We also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed FPGA architecture on an image search problem, finding the darkest pixel of a grey image. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves significant speedup compared to the other software versions of the BB-BC algorithm and converges much faster than a typical GA algorithm making it an ideal solution for real-time embedded applications.",ar,2020-10-01,Journal of Signal Processing Systems,ANFIS | Big bang-big crunch optimization algorithm | FPGA-based acceleration | Genetic algorithm | Real-time applications,2-s2.0-85079737377,,,Article,Psarakis M.,60110806;60010667,University of West Attica;University of Piraeus,Athens;Piraeus,Greece;Greece,5,"Psarakis, Mihalis;Dounis, Anastasios;Almabrok, Abdoalnasir;Stavrinidis, Stavros;Gkekas, Georgios",6603176127;6701744357;57204451682;56976356200;26532772700,60010667;60110806;60010667;60110806;60010667,1 October 2020,19398018,11400153333,19398115,Journal,92,10,,1155-1176,0,,undefined,,5,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11265-020-01522-5,,Excluido por nada que ver (FPGA)

It combines the strengths of deep learning and traditional SLAM techniques to produce visually compelling 3D semantic models. The key success comes from our novel segmentation scheme and the efficient instance-level data fusion, which are both implemented on GPU. Specifically, for each incoming RGBD frame, we take the advantages of the RGBD features, the 3D point cloud, and the reconstructed model to perform instance-level segmentation. The corresponding RGBD data along with the instance ID are then fused to the surfel-based models. In order to sufficiently store and update these data, we design and implement a new data structure using the OpenGL Shading Language.

The swarm intelligence optimisation algorithm has certain advantages in solving such multi-objective optimisation problems, so this Letter proposes to apply the pigeon-inspired optimisation (PIO) algorithm to the path planning problem. However, the traditional PIO algorithm is suffering from the problems of easy to get into local optimisation, low stability and premature convergence. To overcome its shortcomings, this Letter proposes a logistic beetle algorithm search-PIO (LBAS-PIO) algorithm. In the optimisation process of the LBAS-PIO algorithm, the PIO algorithm is initialised by the logistic mapping, making the search space more extensive. Learning from the idea of the beetle algorithm search, each pigeon has its own judgment of the environment and the number of iterations and search time are reduced. Further, the path evaluation function of the algorithm and the execution order of the operators are optimised to make the algorithm smoother and easier to find the global optimal solution.

NO,10.1007/s00170-020-06066-3,Design and characterization of an instrumented hand-held power tool to capture dynamic interaction with the workpiece during manual operations,"In recent years, robots have contributed extensively to the automation of repetitive tasks for which position control-based approaches represent effective solutions. However, other contact tasks such as finishing, deburring and grinding require both position and force control. To date, despite the availability of cost-effective robotic solutions, such tasks are still carried out manually by skilled operators mainly because programming is time consuming and not sufficiently flexible to be readapted to product or task changes. An alternative approach is teaching by demonstration, by instrumenting hand-held tools for capturing both the force and the contact point while an expert operator performs tooling tasks. This paper presents a novel approach for instrumenting hand-held tools for polishing/grinding used in monitoring the performance of skilled human operators which can be, in future work, translated into planning strategies for robot programming and control. More specifically, the instrumented tool is designed to monitor interaction forces with the workpiece and point of contact, where these interaction forces arise. The key element in our design is a flexible coupler which, ideally, only transmits rotation torques to spin the polishing/grinding wheel while all the remaining torque and force components are transmitted through a parallel structure and sensed by a 6-axis loadcell.

NO,10.3390/app10217419,A ROS-based open tool for intelligent robotics education,"This paper presents an open-access platform for practical learning of intelligent robotics in engineering degrees: Robotics-Academy. It comprises a collection of exercises including recent service robot applications in real life, with different robots such as autonomous cars, drones or vacuum cleaners. It uses Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware, the de facto standard in robot programming, the 3D Gazebo simulator and the Python programming language. For each exercise, a software template has been developed, performing all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student’s code. Using this template, the student just focuses on the robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details which have little educational value. The templates are coded as ROS nodes or as Jupyter Notebooks ready to use in the web browser. Reference solutions for illustrative purposes and automatic assessment tools for gamification have also been developed. An introductory course to intelligent robotics has been elaborated and its contents are available and ready to use at Robotics-Academy, including reactive behaviors, path planning, local/global navigation, and self-localization algorithms. Robotics- Academy provides a valuable complement to master classes in blended learning, massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online video courses, devoted to addressing theoretical content. This open educational tool connects that theory with practical robot applications and is suitable to be used in distance education.

NO,10.1145/3396235,Optimizing Tensor Contractions for Embedded Devices with Racetrack and DRAM Memories,"Tensor contraction is a fundamental operation in many algorithms with a plethora of applications ranging from quantum chemistry over fluid dynamics and image processing to machine learning. The performance of tensor computations critically depends on the efficient utilization of on-chip/off-chip memories. In the context of low-power embedded devices, efficient management of the memory space becomes even more crucial, in order to meet energy constraints. This work aims at investigating strategies for performance-and energy-efficient tensor contractions on embedded systems, using racetrack memory (RTM)-based scratch-pad memory (SPM) and DRAM-based off-chip memory. Compiler optimizations such as the loop access order and data layout transformations paired with architectural optimizations such as prefetching and preshifting are employed to reduce the shifting overhead in RTMs. Optimizations for off-chip memory such as memory access order, data mapping and the choice of a suitable memory access granularity are employed to reduce the contention in the off-chip memory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed optimizations improve the SPM performance and energy consumption by 32% and 73%, respectively, compared to an iso-capacity SRAM. The overall DRAM dynamic energy consumption improvements due to memory optimizations amount to 80%.",ar,2020-11-01,ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems,Compiler optimization | data transformation | DRAM mapping | embedded systems | matrix multiplication | prefetching | preshifting | racetrack memory | tensor contraction | tensors,2-s2.0-85096079619,,,Article,Khan A.A.,60089655;60018353,"Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad;Technische Universität Dresden",Islamabad;Dresden,Pakistan;Germany,4,"Khan, Asif Ali;Rink, Norman A.;Hameed, Fazal;Castrillon, Jeronimo",57201093608;57189378973;55883767200;24779298800,60018353;60018353;60089655;60018353,November 2020,15399087,10300153313,15583465,Journal,19,6,44,,0,DFG,CA 1602/4-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,1,2020,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3396235,,Excluido por nada que ver

NO,10.1016/j.jsr.2020.09.002,Safety climate at agricultural cooperatives,"Introduction: This study identifies determinants of safety climate at agricultural cooperatives. Methods: An extensive survey was designed to build upon past research done in collaboration with DuPont (Risch et al., 2014). In 2014 and 2015, the survey was administered to 1930 employees at 14 different agricultural cooperatives with 154 locations. Injury incidence data were also collected from each location to better understand the overall health and safety environment in this sector. An ordered probit model is used to identify variables that are associated with better safety climates. Results: Safety system components such as discipline programs, inspection programs, modified duty programs, off-the-job safety training programs, and recognition programs are positively related to individual safety climate for both managerial employees and nonmanagerial employees. Variables representing an employee's agricultural background, distance between their workplace and childhood home, and formal education are not associated with managerial safety climate. However, agricultural background and childhood home distance are associated with nonmanagerial safety climate. Conclusions: Improving occupational health and safety is a priority for many agricultural cooperatives. Lower safety climate emerges as nonmanagerial employees have more experience with production agriculture and work nearer to their home community. Practical applications: Employees of agricultural cooperatives face a host of health and safety challenges that are likely to persist into the future. The safety system components associated with safety climate indicate that continuous feedback is important for improving occupational health and safety.

Motion path planning is an important part of soccer training assisted robot decision system. Path planning aims to find an optimal path, complete dynamic and static obstacle avoidance, and thus can timely and quickly carry out the path planning of the soccer training assisted robot cooperation strategy. Aiming at the problem of soccer training auxiliary robot motion path planning, this paper proposes a global path planning method based on genetic algorithm, which avoids the problem of unsmooth path and large computation. Under the premise of ensuring the completeness of search, this method transforms the soccer training assisted robot path planning problem into the path search problem of the soccer training assisted robot system center. Under the premise of using the fixed-point rotation method on a large scale, the genetic algorithm is adopted for the case of some special narrow-channel environments, and the action area is determined by simple search. Finally, the planning path of each soccer training-assisted robot in the system is obtained.

NO,10.1007/s10846-020-01240-x,iADA*: Improved Anytime Path Planning and Replanning Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicle,"Path planning of autonomous mobile robots in a real-world environment presents several challenges which are usually not raised in other areas. The real world is inherently complex, uncertain and dynamic. Therefore, accurate models of path planning are difficult to obtain and quickly become outdated. Anytime planners are ideal for this type of problem as they can find an initial solution very quickly and then improve it as time allows. This paper proposes a new anytime incremental search algorithm named improved Anytime Dynamic A*(iADA*). The algorithm is based on the currently popular anytime heuristic search algorithm, which is Anytime Dynamic A*(ADA*). The iADA* algorithm improves the calculation of the path lengths and decreases the calculating frequency of the path throughout the search, making it significantly faster. The algorithm is designed to provide an efficient solution to a complex, dynamic search environment when the locally changes affected. Our study shows that the two-dimensional path-planning iADA* experiments were between 2.0 to 3.7 times faster than ADA*, both in partially known and fully unknown dynamic environments. Additionally, in this paper shows the experiment results of the comparison with other four existing algorithms based on computing time and path lengths. iADA* was an average 2.57 times reduced on the computational time for the environment which locally changes effected. For the path length is little increase, but it is not the worst case. According to the experiments, the more the environmental problems and complexity increases, the more iADA* provides a rapid in-search time and total time to obtain the final solution.",ar,2020-12-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,Anytime algorithm | Concurrent path planner | Dynamic environment | Path planning and replanning | Real-time path planner,2-s2.0-85089028908,,,Article,Maw A.A.,60000142,Konkuk University,Seoul,South Korea,3,"Maw, Aye Aye;Tyan, Maxim;Lee, Jae Woo",57200515025;55805366800;57203409283,60000142;60000142;60000142,December 2020,9210296,24360,15730409,Journal,100,3-4,,1005-1013,0,KU,undefined,Konkuk University,4,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10846-020-01240-x,,Excluido por no educación (path planning)
NO,10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106796,Optimal path planning approach based on Q-learning algorithm for mobile robots,"In fact, optimizing path within short computation time still remains a major challenge for mobile robotics applications. In path planning and obstacles avoidance, Q-Learning (QL) algorithm has been widely used as a computational method of learning through environment interaction. However, less emphasis is placed on path optimization using QL because of its slow and weak convergence toward optimal solutions. Therefore, this paper proposes an Efficient Q-Learning (EQL) algorithm to overcome these limitations and ensure an optimal collision-free path in less possible time. In the QL algorithm, successful learning is closely dependent on the design of an effective reward function and an efficient selection strategy for an optimal action that ensures exploration and exploitation. In this regard, a new reward function is proposed to initialize the Q-table and provide the robot with prior knowledge of the environment, followed by a new efficient selection strategy proposal to accelerate the learning process through search space reduction while ensuring a rapid convergence toward an optimized solution. The main idea is to intensify research at each learning stage, around the straight-line segment linking the current position of the robot to Target (optimal path in terms of length). During the learning process, the proposed strategy favors promising actions that not only lead to an optimized path but also accelerate the convergence of the learning process. The proposed EQL algorithm is first validated using benchmarks from the literature, followed by a comparison with other existing QL-based algorithms. The achieved results showed that the proposed EQL gained good learning proficiency; besides, the training performance is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art. Concluded, EQL improves the quality of the paths in terms of length, computation time and robot safety, furthermore outperforms other optimization algorithms.",ar,2020-12-01,Applied Soft Computing Journal,Convergence speed | Efficient Q-Learning | Efficient selection strategy | Path optimization | Training performances,2-s2.0-85093654162,S1568494620307341,,Article,Maoudj A.,60068734,Centre de Développement des Technologies Avancées,Algiers,Algeria,2,"Maoudj, Abderraouf;Hentout, Abdelfetah",56997528500;24721256800,60068734;60068734,December 2020,15684946,18136,,Journal,97,,106796,,0,,undefined,,9,2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494620307341?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used.

Introducing software engineering principles into end-user programming could improve the quality of the developed software applications. For example, model-driven development improves technology independence and adaptive systems act upon changes in their context of use. However, end-users need to apply such principles in a non-daunting manner and without incurring a steep learning curve. This paper presents EUD-MARS that aims to provide end-users with a simple approach for developing model-driven adaptive robotics software. End-users include people like hobbyists and students who are not professional programmers but are interested in programming robots. EUD-MARS supports robots like hobby drones and educational humanoids that are available for end-users. It offers a tool for software developers and another one for end-users. We evaluated EUD-MARS from three perspectives. First, we used EUD-MARS to program different types of robots and assessed its visual programming language against existing design principles. Second, we asked software developers to use EUD-MARS to configure robots and obtained their feedback on strengths and points for improvement. Third, we observed how end-users explain and develop EUD-MARS programs, and obtained their feedback mainly on understandability, ease of programming, and desirability.

The advantage of using a personally developed solution is its open structure, which allows various tests and measurements to be performed, and that is highly convenient for educational and research purposes. The motivation behind the design of this personal didactic robot control environment arose from a survey for students after the first Summer School on Mechatronic Systems. The student questionnaire revealed severe discrepancies between theory and practice in education. Even though the primary purpose of the new control environment for robot PUMA 560 was research, it was established that it is a viable lab resource that allows for the connection between theoretical and industrial robotics.

NO,10.6041/j.issn.1000-1298.2020.12.002,Trajectory Planning Method for Apple Picking Manipulator Based on Stepwise Migration Strategy,"Picking trajectory planning is one of the important research aspects of apple picking manipulator. The unstructured natural environment leads to low training efficiency for picking trajectory planning based on deep reinforcement learning. A deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) based on a stepwise migration strategy was proposed for apple picking trajectory planning. Firstly, a progressive spatially constrained stepwise training strategy based on DDPG was put forward to solve the problem of hard converging in natural environments. Secondly, the transfer learning idea was utilized to migrate the strategies obtained from the obstacle-free scenario to the simple obstacle scenario, from the simple obstacle scenario to the hybrid obstacle scenario, to accelerate the training process in an obstacle scenario from prior strategies and guide the obstacle avoidance trajectory planning of the apple picking manipulator. Finally, the simulation experiments on the multi-degree-of-freedom apple picking manipulator for picking trajectory planning were carried out, and the results showed that the stepwise migration strategy can improve the training efficiency and network performance of the DDPG algorithm.

NO,10.1109/TASE.2021.3128639,A Self-Supervised Learning-Based 6-DOF Grasp Planning Method for Manipulator,"To realize a robust robotic grasping system for unknown objects in an unstructured environment, large amounts of grasp data and 3D model data for the object are required; the sizes of these data directly affect the rate of successful grasps. To reduce the time cost of data acquisition and labeling and increase the rate of successful grasps, we developed a self-supervised learning mechanism to control grasp tasks performed by manipulators. First, a manipulator automatically collects the point cloud for the objects from multiple perspectives to increase the efficiency of data acquisition. The complete point cloud for the objects is obtained using the hand-eye vision of the manipulator and the truncated signed distance function algorithm. Then, the point cloud data for the objects are used to generate a series of six-degrees-of-freedom grasp poses, and the force-closure decision algorithm is used to add the grasp quality label to each grasp pose to realize the automatic labeling of grasp data. Finally, the point cloud in the gripper closing area corresponding to each grasp pose is obtained and used to train the grasp-quality classification model for the manipulator. The results of performing actual grasping experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised learning method can increase the rate of successful grasps for the manipulator.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,3D reconstruction. | Data models | grasp planning | Grasping | Manipulator | Manipulators | Planning | Point cloud compression | self-supervised learning | Solid modeling | Three-dimensional displays,2-s2.0-85118717367,,,Article,Peng G.,60031003;60025761;60005244,CQUniversity Australia;Huazhong University of Science and Technology;Southeast University,Rockhampton;Wuhan;Nanjing,Australia;China;China,5,"Peng, Gang;Ren, Zhenyu;Wang, Hao;Li, Xinde;Khyam, Mohammad Omar",7201806213;57222182578;57222189283;14034295300;55795445900,60025761;60025761;60025761;60005244;60031003,2021,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,,,,,1,,undefined,,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2021.3128639,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1109/TRO.2021.3109414,LAMP: Learning a Motion Policy to Repeatedly Navigate in an Uncertain Environment,"Mobile robots are often tasked with repeatedly navigating through an environment whose traversability changes over time. These changes may exhibit some hidden structure, which can be learned. Many studies consider reactive algorithms for online planning, however, these algorithms do not take advantage of the past executions of the navigation task for future tasks. In this article, we formalize the problem of minimizing the total expected cost to perform multiple start-to-goal navigation tasks on a roadmap by introducing the learned reactive planning problem. We propose a method that captures information from past executions to learn a motion policy to handle obstacles that the robot has seen before. We propose the LAMP framework, which integrates the generated motion policy with an existing navigation stack. Finally, an extensive set of experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by 10&#x0025; to 40&#x0025; in terms of expected time to travel from start to goal.

However, most of them rely on excellent programming technology for development, in parallelism with exhibiting inconvenient interaction or unsatisfactory recognition rates in most cases. OBJECTIVE: To develop a convenient human-computer interaction mode with a high recognition rate, which allows users to make the robot show excellent adaptability in the new environment without programming ability. METHODS: A visual interaction method based on deep learning was used to develop the feeding robot: when the camera detects that the user's mouth is open for 2 seconds, the feeding command is turned on, and the feeding is temporarily conducted when the eyes are closed for 2 seconds. A programming method of learning from the demonstration, which is simple and has strong adaptability to different environments, was employed to generate a feeding trajectory.

NO,10.1002/cae.22464,Model-based automatic grading of object-oriented programming assignments,"Automatic grading of object-oriented programming (OOP) assignments is an important problem from practical, theoretical, and educational viewpoints. Apart from computing a specific grade, an effective grading method needs to provide systematic feedback comments to both the design and code elements. Existing works have proposed grading methods that make various assumptions about the design. However, none of these methods have considered using a design language for the program model. A challenge here is to use a language that eases learning and application in program design. In this paper, we propose a novel grading method, named OOPGRADER, which automatically grades OOP assignments constructed based on an essentially detailed program model. This model is defined in an embedded design language, which directly uses the annotation feature of OOP language to express the essential design rules. We explain how programming assignments can be designed with this language and propose a program checker and a grader for both student and teacher to use in working on the assignments and in grading them. We implement these components in a tool and develop an Eclipse plugin for this tool. We evaluate our method using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The main result is that our method helps students effectively learn to program through detailed feedback comments based on a program model.

In recent years, the use of the arts as an enhancer of the educational experience has been incorporated into STEM education.

SI,10.15388/infedu.2021.22,Designing Informatics Curriculum for K-12 Education: From Concepts to Implementations,"Computing as a  discipline has common roots with mathematics and written languages, and computing as a  way of thinking and handling has been integral to human culture since ever. This is not only a  reasonable argument for convincing society to consider informatics as one of the very fundamental pillars of education, but it also puts the potential contributions of teaching informatics in schools into the correct perspective in the context of science and humanities. Many European countries are switching from teaching information technologies to informatics education during the current second decade of this century. Informatics curriculum is becoming a  central part of school education. We explain and design a  way of developing informatics curriculum that offer the critical competences new generations need to survive and thrive in todays’ knowledge society and will allow them to contribute to the future development of society. These competences also strongly support the development of their intellectual potential and creativity. Our design of informatics curriculum takes into account the interaction with other scientific disciplines as well with the subject didactics, pedagogy and psychology. The starting point is merging constructionism and critical thinking. Constructionism with its “learning by doing” and “learning by getting things to work” enables designing a  teaching process in which students acquire knowledge by creating products, analysing the properties and the functionality of their own products, and finally derive motivation to improve these products. Critical thinking asks us not to teach products of science and technology and their application, but to teach the creative process of their development. To implement this approach, we use the historical method allowing the students to learn by productive failures in the process of searching for a  solution. To organize the process of learning and make the different steps available to the appropriate age groups we take into account the cognitive dimensions of the revised taxonomy of Bloom. To illustrate how the combination of all these concepts works we present a  detailed curriculum for algorithm design, programming, robotics, and communication in networks.",ar,2021-01-01,Informatics in Education,Bloom’s taxonomy | computational thinking | computer science | computing education | digital competences | informatics | informatics concepts | informatics curriculum | informatics education,2-s2.0-85115615061,,,Article,Dagienė V.,60059987;60025858,Vilniaus Universitetas;ETH Zürich,"Vilnius;Zurich ZH,",Lithuania;Switzerland,3,"Dagienė, Valentina;Hromkovič, Juraj;Lacher, Regula",9638194400;7006735215;57198516161,60059987;60025858;60025858,2021,16485831,4100151705,,Journal,20,3,,333-360,1,UEF,undefined,Itä-Suomen Yliopisto,0,2021,https://infedu.vu.lt/journal/INFEDU/article/702/info,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KEFFZUxI5Y7uTq5s3Xp9pMJAIg7ceYIb/view?usp=sharing,
NO,10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3088063,Batch Reinforcement Learning with a Nonparametric Off-Policy Policy Gradient,"Off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) holds the promise of better data efficiency as it allows sample reuse and potentially enables safe interaction with the environment. Current off-policy policy gradient methods either suffer from high bias or high variance, delivering often unreliable estimates. The price of inefficiency becomes evident in real-world scenarios such as interaction-driven robot learning, where the success of RL has been rather limited, and a very high sample cost hinders straightforward application. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric Bellman equation, which can be solved in closed form. The solution is differentiable w.r.t the policy parameters and gives access to an estimation of the policy gradient. In this way, we avoid the high variance of importance sampling approaches, and the high bias of semi-gradient methods. We empirically analyze the quality of our gradient estimate against state-of-the-art methods, and we show that it outperforms the baselines in terms of sample efficiency on classical control tasks.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,Closed-form solutions | Estimation | Kernel | Mathematical model | Monte Carlo methods | Nonparametric Estimation | Policy Gradient | Reinforcement Leanring | Reinforcement learning | Task analysis,2-s2.0-85111071624,,,Article,Tosatto S.,60030835;60011226,University of Alberta;Technische Universität Darmstadt,Edmonton;Darmstadt,Canada;Germany,3,"Tosatto, Samuele;Carvalho, Joao;Peters, Jan",57201356929;57219633645;35248912800,60030835;60011226;60011226,2021,1628828,24254,19393539,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9449972,,Excluido por machine leraning

NO,10.1007/s10514-020-09947-4,Reinforcement based mobile robot path planning with improved dynamic window approach in unknown environment,"Mobile robot path planning in an unknown environment is a fundamental and challenging problem in the field of robotics. Dynamic window approach (DWA) is an effective method of local path planning, however some of its evaluation functions are inadequate and the algorithm for choosing the weights of these functions is lacking, which makes it highly dependent on the global reference and prone to fail in an unknown environment. In this paper, an improved DWA based on Q-learning is proposed. First, the original evaluation functions are modified and extended by adding two new evaluation functions to enhance the performance of global navigation. Then, considering the balance of effectiveness and speed, we define the state space, action space and reward function of the adopted Q-learning algorithm for the robot motion planning. After that, the parameters of the proposed DWA are adaptively learned by Q-learning and a trained agent is obtained to adapt to the unknown environment. At last, by a series of comparative simulations, the proposed method shows higher navigation efficiency and successful rate in the complex unknown environment.

Moreover, it is found that the relative motion between moving obstacles and robots may cause abnormal rewards and further lead to a collision between robot and obstacle. To address this problem, two reward thresholds are set to modify the abnormal rewards, and the experiments shows that the robot can avoid all obstacles and reach the goal successfully. Finally, double DQN (DDQN) and dueling DQN are applied in this article. This article compares the results of reward-modified DQN (RMDQN), reward-modified DDQN (RMDDQN), dueling RMDQN, and dueling RMDDQN and concludes that the result of RMDDQN is the best.",ar,2021-01-01,Optimal Control Applications and Methods,deep Q-network | dynamic environment | mobile robot | path planning | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85114097466,,,Article,Huang R.,60025345,Guangzhou University,Guangzhou,China,4,"Huang, Runnan;Qin, Chengxuan;Li, Jian Ling;Lan, Xuejing",57242713600;57210745227;57242800800;56653055400,60025345;60025345;60025345;60025345,2021,1432087,25529,10991514,Journal,,,,,0,NNSFC,61803111,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2021,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oca.2781,,Excluido por no tener que ver con educación
NO,10.1007/s12369-021-00775-9,iRoPro: An interactive Robot Programming Framework,"The great diversity of end-user tasks ranging from manufacturing environments to personal homes makes pre-programming robots for general purpose applications extremely challenging. In fact, teaching robots new actions from scratch that can be reused for previously unseen tasks remains a difficult challenge and is generally left up to robotics experts. In this work, we present iRoPro, an interactive Robot Programming framework that allows end-users with little to no technical background to teach a robot new reusable actions. We combine Programming by Demonstration and Automated Planning techniques to allow the user to construct the robot’s knowledge base by teaching new actions by kinesthetic demonstration. The actions are generalised and reused with a task planner to solve previously unseen problems defined by the user. We implement iRoPro as an end-to-end system on a Baxter Research Robot to simultaneously teach low- and high-level actions by demonstration that the user can customise via a Graphical User Interface to adapt to their specific use case. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we first conducted pre-design experiments to better understand the user’s adoption of involved concepts and the proposed robot programming process. We compare results with post-design experiments, where we conducted a user study to validate the usability of our approach with real end-users. Overall, we showed that users with different programming levels and educational backgrounds can easily learn and use iRoPro and its robot programming process.",ar,2021-01-01,International Journal of Social Robotics,Automated planning | End-User robot programming | Human-Robot interaction | Programming by demonstration,2-s2.0-85103669316,,,Article,Liang Y.S.,60108044,Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble,Saint Martin d'Heres,France,4,"Liang, Ying Siu;Pellier, Damien;Fiorino, Humbert;Pesty, Sylvie",57194637692;12769915400;12768587700;23005999000,60108044;60108044;60108044;60108044,2021,18754791,19500157063,18754805,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,1,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12369-021-00775-9,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NR7cZd0kCIGs61YTTdRFgWyypj9rXMgI/view?usp=sharing,"Creo que habla más que nada de ""enseñar"" acciones al robot, así que no entraría pero igual revisar por las dudas

A key challenge in PBE is to efficiently discover a user-intended program in the search space that can be exponentially large. In this work, we propose a method for automatic synthesis of functional programs on list manipulation, by using offline-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to guide the program search. We adopt miniKanren, an embedded domain-specific language for flexible relational programming, as an underlying top-down deductive search engine of candidate programs that are consistent with input-output examples. Our approach targets an easy and effective integration of deep learning techniques in making better PBE systems and combines two technical ideas on generating diverse training dataset and designing rich feature embeddings of probable subproblems for synthesis generated by deductive search. The offline-learned model is then used in PBE to guide the top-down deductive search with specific strategies. To practically manipulate data structures of lists, our method synthesizes functional programs with popular higher-order combinators including map , foldl and foldr. We have implemented our method and evaluated it with challenging program synthesis tasks on list manipulation. The experiments show promising results on the performance of our method compared to related state-of-the-art inductive synthesizers.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Access,deductive search | deep learning | functional programs | miniKanren | Programming by examples | relational programming,2-s2.0-85105851507,,,Article,Wang Y.,60021200,East China Normal University,Shanghai,China,2,"Wang, Yuhong;Li, Xin",57223441155;56469851500,60021200;60021200,2021,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,9,,9427519,71521-71534,1,NSFC,17PJ1402200,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427519,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3139145,Learning Selective Communication for Multi-Agent Path Finding,"Learning communication via deep reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning (IL) has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). However, existing communication based MAPF solvers focus on broadcast communication, where an agent broadcasts its message to all other or predefined agents. It is not only impractical but also leads to redundant information that could even impair the multi-agent cooperation. A succinct communication scheme should learn which information is relevant and influential to each agents decision making process. To address this problem, we consider a request-reply scenario and propose Decision Causal Communication (DCC), a simple yet efficient model to enable agents to select neighbors to conduct communication during both training and execution. Specifically, a neighbor is determined as relevant and influential only when the presence of this neighbor causes the decision adjustment on the central agent. This judgment is learned only based on agent's local observation and thus suitable for decentralized execution to handle large scale problems. Empirical evaluation in obstacle-rich environment indicates the high success rate with low communication overhead of our method.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Computer science | Games | Markov processes | Motion and Path Planning | Observability | Path Planning for Multiple Mobile Robots or Agents | Protocols | Reinforcement learning | Reinforcement Learning | Training,2-s2.0-85122290224,,,Article,Ma Z.,60018491;60014171;60006541,Simon Fraser University;University of Waterloo;The University of Hong Kong,Burnaby;Waterloo;Pokfulam,Canada;Canada;Hong Kong,3,"Ma, Ziyuan;Luo, Yudong;Pan, Jia",57225982687;57218213777;35786627600,60018491;60014171;60006541,2021,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3139145,,Excluido por path finding

Environment assumptions are the expectations that a system or a component makes about its operational environment and are often specified in terms of conditions over the inputs of that system or component. In this article, we propose an approach to automatically infer environment assumptions for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Our approach improves the state-of-the-art in three different ways: First, we learn assumptions for complex CPS models involving signal and numeric variables; second, the learned assumptions include arithmetic expressions defined over multiple variables; third, we identify the trade-off between soundness and coverage of environment assumptions and demonstrate the flexibility of our approach in prioritizing either of these criteria. We evaluate our approach using a public domain benchmark of CPS models from Lockheed Martin and a component of a satellite control system from LuxSpace, a satellite system provider. The results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on learning assumptions for CPS models, and further, when applied to our industrial CPS model, our approach is able to learn assumptions that are sufficiently close to the assumptions manually developed by engineers to be of practical value.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,Attitude control | Computational modeling | Decision trees | Environment assumptions | Genetic programming | Machine learning | Mathematical model | Model checking | Model checking | Numerical models | Satellites | Searchbased software testing | Software packages,2-s2.0-85112623797,,,Article,Gaaloul K.,60072562;60028897,University of Luxembourg;University of Ottawa,Esch-sur-Alzette;Ottawa,Luxembourg;Canada,5,"Gaaloul, Khouloud;Menghi, Claudio;Nejati, Shiva;Briand, Lionel;Isasi Parache, Yago",57217902396;55532052400;18038340600;7006613079;57192158287,60072562;60072562;60028897;60028897;,2021,985589,18711,19393520,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9507379,,Excluido por machine learning

However, existing works in both industry and academia mainly focus on adaptive robot planning, while seldom consider human operators intentions in advance. Hence, it hinders the HRCA transition towards a proactive manner. To overcome the bottleneck, this research proposes a multimodal transfer learning-enabled action prediction approach, serving as the prerequisite to ensure the Proactive HRCA. Firstly, a multimodal intelligence-based action recognition approach is proposed to predict ongoing human actions by leveraging the visual stream and skeleton stream with short-time input frames. Secondly, a transfer learning-enabled model is adapted to transfer learned knowledge from daily activities to industrial assembly operations rapidly for online operator intention analysis. Thirdly, a dynamic decision-making mechanism including the robotic decision and motion control is described to allow mobile robots to assist operators in a proactive manner.

At present, the 2D perception visual welding guidance programming method is commonly used which cannot accurately locate and model the complicated 3D spatial curve welding seam. The 2D perception method can hardly meet the requirements of welding process. In this paper, a welding seam perception method based on a line structure-light sensor was proposed, which optimizes the generation of the weld seam trajectory, and builds a highly adaptable intelligent guidance programming system for welding robots. Firstly, 3D modeling perception of welding parts is realized through eye-in-hand system of robot, which solves the problem that offline programming system cannot be applied when the welding model is not precise enough or partly miss. Secondly, aiming at solving extraction problem of common types of 3D space curve welding seam, corresponding types of weld extraction algorithms are proposed according to the characteristics of different types of welds under the general process of weld extraction. These methods not only can directly extract the weld from the ordered point cloud with high precision and resolution, but also are less affected by the welding environment, which solve the problem of low perception accuracy of complex curved welds in 3D space. Then, on the basis of welding seam extraction, NURBS curves are used to realize the optimal generation of weld trajectory.

Effective understanding of the surrounding environment and efficient generation of an optimal collision-free path are both critical parts for solving path planning problems. Although conventional sampling-based algorithms, such as the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and its improved optimal version (RRT*), have been widely used in path planning problems because of their ability to find a feasible path in even complex environments, they fail to find an optimal path efficiently. To solve this problem and satisfy the two aforementioned requirements, we propose a novel learning-based path planning algorithm which consists of a novel generative model based on the conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) and a modified RRT* algorithm (denoted by CGAN-RRT*). Given the map information, our CGAN model can generate an efficient probability distribution of feasible paths, which can be utilized by the CGAN-RRT* algorithm to find an optimal path with a non-uniform sampling strategy.

A learning optimization (LO) framework is established. Multiple criteria are defined to evaluate the performance quantitatively, and implementations with different sub-methods are discussed. In particular, a database generation method based on input space mapping is proposed for generating valid and representative samples. The methods presented are applied on a practical application—haptic interaction in virtual reality systems. The results show that the input space mapping method significantly elevates the efficiency and quality of database generation and consequently improves the performance of the LO. With the LO method, real-time trajectory generation with high dimensional inputs is achieved, which lays the foundation for robots with high dimensional DOFs to execute complex tasks in dynamic environments.",ar,2021-01-01,Engineering Optimization,global optimization | human–robot interaction | machine learning | Real-time trajectory planning | serial manipulators,2-s2.0-85113255459,,,Article,Zhang S.,60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,3,"Zhang, Shiyu;Dai, Shuling;Zhao, Yongjia",57200408462;57219752346;36095369500,60013789;60013789;60013789,2021,0305215X,29114,10290273,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0305215X.2021.1958210,,Excluido por no tener que ver con educación
NO,10.1109/TEVC.2021.3106672,Genetic Programming for Manifold Learning: Preserving Local Topology,"Manifold learning methods are an invaluable tool in today&#x2019;s world of increasingly huge datasets. Manifold learning algorithms can discover a much lower-dimensional representation (embedding) of a high-dimensional dataset through non-linear transformations that preserve the most important structure of the original data. State-of-the-art manifold learning methods directly optimise an embedding without mapping between the original space and the discovered embedded space. This makes interpretability &#x2014; a key requirement in exploratory data analysis &#x2014; nearly impossible. Recently, genetic programming has emerged as a very promising approach to manifold learning by evolving functional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic programming-based manifold learning has struggled to match the performance of other approaches. In this work, we propose a new approach to using genetic programming for manifold learning, which preserves local topology. This is expected to significantly improve performance on tasks where local neighbourhood structure (topology) is paramount. We compare our proposed approach with various baseline manifold learning methods and find that it often outperforms other methods, including a clear improvement over previous genetic programming approaches. These results are particularly promising, given the potential interpretability and reusability of the evolved mappings.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation,Computational modeling | Evolutionary Learning.. | Feature Construction | Feature Selection | Genetic Programming | Genetic programming | Manifold learning | Manifold Learning | Manifolds | Numerical models | Task analysis | Topology,2-s2.0-85113864073,,,Article,Lensen A.,60002316,Victoria University of Wellington,Wellington,New Zealand,3,"Lensen, Andrew;Xue, Bing;Zhang, Mengjie",57188680921;55329093700;8729040400,60002316;60002316;60002316,2021,1089778X,25037,19410026,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9520652,,Excluido por machine learning

Different from child–robot interactions as investigated in the social robot field, student–robot (S–R) interactions focus mainly on the process of interaction between learners and programmable robot kits in RE settings. At a four-week robotics summer camp in China, mixed-methods research was conducted. Forty primary school students and one dedicated robotics teacher participated in this research, while 32 students and the teacher completed all the lessons and data collection procedures of the summer camp. Results indicated that students’ CT skill increased during the summer camp and that the change in their CT skill was positively correlated to the time spent on S–R interaction. Additionally, how three kinds of S–R interaction—programming-computing, observational investigation, and participatory investigation—cultivated students’ CT were found. Moreover, the hierarchy of three S–R interactions and students’ role-shifting in the hierarchy were discussed. Previous studies rarely discussed S–R interaction; however, this kind of interaction should be explored because it provides more information about students’ natural learning process, which might be meaningful to RE practice.",ar,2021-01-01,International Journal of Technology and Design Education,China | Computational thinking | Robotics education | Student–robot interactions | Summer camp,2-s2.0-85107792880,,,Article,Qu J.R.,60017919,The Education University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,China,2,"Qu, Jing Ru;Fok, Ping Kwan",57223279607;25027197400,60017919;60017919,2021,9577572,21389,15731804,Journal,,,,,1,,undefined,,1,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10798-021-09677-3,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KR-Sq3I0NAkt5AK1SFAYhn76OkZvIW7H/view?usp=sharing,
NO,10.1109/TCDS.2021.3137262,A Framework of Improving Human Demonstration Efficiency for Goal-Directed Robot Skill Learning,"Robot learning from humans allows robots to automatically adjust to stochastic and dynamic environments by learning from non-technical end user&#x2019;s demonstrations, which is best known as robot programming by demonstration, robot learning from demonstration, apprenticeship learning, and imitation learning. Although most of those methods are probabilistic, and their performances intensively depend on the demonstrated data, measuring and evaluating human demonstrations are rarely investigated. A poorly demonstrated dataset with useless prior knowledge or redundant demonstrations increases the complexity and time cost of robot learning. To solve these problems, a goal-directed robot skill learning framework named GPm-MOGP is presented. It 1) decides when and where to add a new demonstration by calculating the trajectory uncertainty, 2) determines which demonstration is useless or redundant by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, 3) implements robot skill learning with a minimum number of demonstrations using a multi-output Gaussian process, and 4) learns orientation uncertainty and representation by combining logarithmic and exponential maps. The proposed framework significantly reduces the demonstrated effort of non-technical end users who lack an understanding of how and what the robot learns during the demonstrating process. To evaluate the proposed framework, a pick-and-place experiment was designed with five unseen goals to verify the effectiveness of our methods. This experiment is well illustrated with two phases: demonstration efficiency and skill representation and reproduction. Results indicate an improvement of 60% in human demonstration efficiency, compared to common LfD applications that require at least 10 demonstrations, and the robot average success rate of pick-and-place task reaches 85%.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,Measurement uncertainty | Probabilistic logic | Robot learning | Robots | Task analysis | Trajectory | Uncertainty,2-s2.0-85122071300,,,Article,Wu H.,127067021,Guangdong Academy of Sciences,Guangdong,China,4,"Wu, Hongmin;Yan, Wu;Xu, Zhihao;Zhou, Xuefeng",56650300300;57204598751;57214001897;55743312800,127067021;127067021;127067021;127067021,2021,23798920,21100784665,23798939,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2021.3137262,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

This article presents the design, development, implementation, and assessment of a Robotic Assistant (RA), named 'Atent@', as a support tool in the homework activities of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Interacting with the children the RA helps them correct their bad habits and misbehavior caused by the disorder. Its features and functionalities were designed by therapists, implementing AI algorithms to process information and make decisions in real-time to help children to be focused on their homework. This RA interacts with smart objects deployed at home, which are associated with the activity under observation (desk and chair). This solution allows therapists to receive more accurate information about the homework sessions inside the home. At the same time, remote interaction with the child is made possible (through the RA) to provide new instructions and support him/her along with the sessions. This RA is a significant evolution of an earlier version. All the improvements brought to the project by the modifications in technical and qualitative features are explained. Furthermore, the experiment and its results are presented to illustrate the clinical potential.

Finding the optimal path is done using the Bees Algorithm (BA) with the Q-Learning Algorithm. A new method to build the initial population is proposed to find the initial population regardless of the number and location of obstacles in the environment. Q-Learning is implemented as a local search function of the BA. The hybridization of the BA and the Q-Learning aims to find the optimal path with a fewer number of iterations of the BA. This method takes advantage of the BA to solve the problem without constraints and the sterilization in the Q-Learning to find the shortest path. The experiment is run on some different maps to validate the proposed method in the static and dynamic case. The experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal path. The comparison is executed to view the superiority of this method in finding the shortest path in the comparison of the results of other algorithms.,ar,2021-01-01,Journal of Field Robotics,Dynamic obstacle avoidance | machine learning | Optimization | path plannin of mobile robot,2-s2.0-85120943256,,,Article,Bonny T.,60070813,University of Sharjah,Sharjah,United Arab Emirates,2,"Bonny, Talal;Kashkash, Mariam",15060068900;57200450345,60070813;60070813,2021,15564959,4700152301,15564967,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.22052,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

NO,10.1109/TMC.2021.3131318,Path Planning for Adaptive CSI Map Construction with A3C in Dynamic Environments,"The fingerprint localization based Channel State Information (CSI) plays a vital role given the popularity of Location-Based Service. Since its easy implementation, low device cost and CSI provides fine-grained information which can achieve adequate accuracy. However, the main drawback is that the approach has to construct the fingerprint map manually during the off-line stage, which is tedious and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel data collection strategy for path planning based on reinforcement learning, namely Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Given the limited exploration step length, it needs to maximize the informative CSI data for reducing manual cost. We collect a small amount of real data in advance to predict the rewards of all sampling points by multivariate Gaussian process and mutual information. Then the optimization problem is transformed to a sequential decision process, which can exploit the informative path by A3C. We complete the proposed algorithm in two real-world dynamic environments and extensive experiments verify its performance.

However, during applications in the real world, robot needs to overcome the effects of a complex working environment with different types of target objects, so it is more difficult to maintain the quality of action planning, even in the same scene. In order to make an agent have the ability to plan actions in a more adaptive way, the deep attentive deterministic policy gradient algorithm is applied in this article. An attention region proposal network is used to select the message of the pre-exploration area. Then this message is calculated using the adaptive exploration method to regulate the strategy as the target changes. Furthermore, a stratified reward function, which is used to reduce the negative influence of miscellaneous information brought by the sparse reward matrix, is defined according to the distance between the end effector and the center of the pre-exploration area. The results show that the DADPG is able to produce a robust strategy with noise interference, and can train in a more efficient way due to the hierarchical reward function.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Access,attentive exploration method | Feature extraction | Grasping | Grippers | Reinforcement learning | reinforcement learning | Robotic grasping | Service robots | stratified reward function | Task analysis | Training,2-s2.0-85122085166,,,Article,Ji X.,60023813;127423119,"Shanghai University;Jerry Zhaoxin Information Technology Co., Ltd",Shanghai;Shanghai,China;China,5,"Ji, Xiangxin;Xiong, Feng;Kong, Weichang;Wei, Dongfei;Shen, Zeyan",57222186668;57251488500;57393663100;57222179111;57393362200,60023813;60023813;127423119;60023813;60023813,2021,,21100374601,21693536,Journal,,,,,1,,undefined,,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137821,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

NO,10.3233/JIFS-192171,Path planning in an unknown environment based on deep reinforcement learning with prior knowledge,"Path planning in an unknown environment is a basic task for mobile robots to complete tasks. As a typical deep reinforcement learning, deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm has gained wide popularity in path planning tasks due to its self-learning and adaptability to complex environment. However, most of path planning algorithms based on DQN spend plenty of time for model training and the learned model policy depends only on the information observed by sensors. It will cause poor generalization capability for the new task and time waste for model retraining. Therefore, a new deep reinforcement learning method combining DQN with prior knowledge is proposed to reduce training time and enhance generalization capability. In this method, a fuzzy logic controller is designed to avoid the obstacles and help the robot avoid blind exploration for reducing the training time. A target-driven approach is used to address the lack of generalization, in which the learned policy depends on the fusion of observed information and target information. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than DQN algorithm in path planning tasks and the target can be reached without retraining when the path planning task changes.",ar,2021-01-01,Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,deep Q-network | deep reinforcement learning | fuzzy logic controller | Path planning | prior knowledge,2-s2.0-85122028015,,,Article,Lou P.,60022414,Wuhan University of Technology,Wuhan,China,5,"Lou, Ping;Xu, Kun;Jiang, Xuemei;Xiao, Zheng;Yan, Junwei",57240641800;57225875172;38662785300;57198716773;7403729116,60022414;60022414;60022414;60022414;60022414,2021,10641246,23917,18758967,Journal,41,6,,5773-5789,0,NSFC,51905397,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.3233/JIFS-192171,,Excluido por path planning

NO,10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3124366,Robotic Manipulation in Dynamic Scenarios via Bounding-Box-Based Hindsight Goal Generation,"By relabeling past experience with heuristic or curriculum goals, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as hindsight experience replay (HER), hindsight goal generation (HGG), and graph-based HGG (G-HGG) have been able to solve challenging robotic manipulation tasks in multigoal settings with sparse rewards. HGG outperforms HER in challenging tasks in which goals are difficult to explore by learning from a curriculum, in which intermediate goals are selected based on the Euclidean distance to target goals. G-HGG enhances HGG by selecting intermediate goals from a precomputed graph representation of the environment, which enables its applicability in an environment with stationary obstacles. However, G-HGG is not applicable to manipulation tasks with dynamic obstacles, since its graph representation is only valid in static scenarios and fails to provide any correct information to guide the exploration. In this article, we propose bounding-box-based HGG (Bbox-HGG), an extension of G-HGG selecting hindsight goals with the help of image observations of the environment, which makes it applicable to tasks with dynamic obstacles. We evaluate Bbox-HGG on four challenging manipulation tasks, where significant enhancements in both sample efficiency and overall success rate are shown over state-of-the-art algorithms.

In particular, robots are required not only to grasp, move, and release various home objects but also to plan the order and positions for placing the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel planning method that can efficiently estimate the order and positions of the objects to be tidied up by learning the parameters of a probabilistic generative model. The model allows a robot to learn the distributions of the co-occurrence probability of the objects and places to tidy up using the multimodal sensor information collected in a tidied environment. Additionally, we develop an autonomous robotic system to perform the tidy-up operation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by an experimental simulation that reproduces the conditions of the Tidy Up Here task of the World Robot Summit 2018 international robotics competition.

NO,10.15587/1729-4061.2021.237772,DEVELOPMENT OF A PLANAR CABLE PARALLEL ROBOT FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS,"Cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) has the great potential for various applications in industry and in everyday life. They consist of an end effector and a base, which connected by several cables. CDPRs have a large workspace compared to the workspace of classic parallel robots. CDPR have a simpler structure have good dynamic properties, high carrying capacity, mobility and low cost. The only drawback is that the CDPR cables can only work for retraction and cannot push. This article presents the design of a prototype of a planar CDPR with four cables for practical use in the educational process. This prototype of a planar CDPR is necessary for a better understanding of the design features, structure, kinematics, statics and dynamics of the CDPR by students. The planar CDPR performs two translational motions, due to the controlled 4 cables, and one rotational motion of the end effector. The research of the kinematics and statics of the planar cable-driven parallel robot is carried out. Simulation of the motion of a planar cable-driven parallel robot in the Python programming language has been carried out. A design was developed and a prototype of the planar cable-driven parallel robot was manufactured. Experimental researches of a prototype of the planar cable-driven parallel robot have been carried out. The results of experimental researches have shown that the CDPR works well enough. During the tests of the prototype of the planar cable-driven parallel robot, it was found that the distortions of the trajectory of the end effector depend on the tension of the cables. It is necessary to monitor the tension level using strain gauges.

NO,10.1016/j.isatra.2021.03.046,A Hybrid MPC for Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning applied for Planar Robotic Arm,"Recently, deep reinforcement learning techniques have achieved tangible results for learning high dimensional control tasks. Due to the trial and error interaction, between the autonomous agent and the environment, the learning phase is unconstrained and limited to the simulator. Such exploration has an additional drawback of consuming unnecessary samples at the beginning of the learning process. Model-based algorithms, on the other hand, handle this issue by learning the dynamics of the environment. However, model-free algorithms have a higher asymptotic performance than model-based ones. The main contribution of this paper is to construct a hybrid structured algorithm from model predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) (MPC–DRL), that makes use of the benefits of both methods, to satisfy constraint conditions throughout the learning process. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by learning a reachability task.

The results show that most of the selected articles discussed tools that target IoT and education, while other fields such as data science, robotics are emerging. Further, most tools use abstractions to hide implementation details and use similar interaction styles. The predominant platforms for the tools are web and mobile, while desktop-based tools are on the decline.

NO,10.1109/TCYB.2020.2981480,Bioinspired Scene Classification by Deep Active Learning With Remote Sensing Applications,"Accurately classifying sceneries with different spatial configurations is an indispensable technique in computer vision and intelligent systems, for example, scene parsing, robot motion planning, and autonomous driving. Remarkable performance has been achieved by the deep recognition models in the past decade. As far as we know, however, these deep architectures are incapable of explicitly encoding the human visual perception, that is, the sequence of gaze movements and the subsequent cognitive processes. In this article, a biologically inspired deep model is proposed for scene classification, where the human gaze behaviors are robustly discovered and represented by a unified deep active learning (UDAL) framework. More specifically, to characterize objects' components with varied sizes, an objectness measure is employed to decompose each scenery into a set of semantically aware object patches. To represent each region at a low level, a local-global feature fusion scheme is developed which optimally integrates multimodal features by automatically calculating each feature's weight. To mimic the human visual perception of various sceneries, we develop the UDAL that hierarchically represents the human gaze behavior by recognizing semantically important regions within the scenery. Importantly, UDAL combines the semantically salient region detection and the deep gaze shifting path (GSP) representation learning into a principled framework, where only the partial semantic tags are required. Meanwhile, by incorporating the sparsity penalty, the contaminated/redundant low-level regional features can be intelligently avoided. Finally, the learned deep GSP features from the entire scene images are integrated to form an image kernel machine, which is subsequently fed into a kernel SVM to classify different sceneries. Experimental evaluations on six well-known scenery sets (including remote sensing images) have shown the competitiveness of our approach.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,Active learning | bioinspired | contaminated | gaze behavior | machine learning | multimodal | remote sensing,2-s2.0-85101805922,,,Article,Zhang L.,60218018;60020224;60003970,Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence;Wenzhou University;Zhejiang University,Masdar City;Wenzhou;Hangzhou,United Arab Emirates;China;China,7,"Zhang, Luming;Su, Ge;Yin, Jianwei;Li, Ying;Lin, Qiuru;Zhang, Xiaoqin;Shao, Ling",35231925400;57222182040;8249720800;55945677900;57220176427;35232030000;55643855000,60020224;60003970;60003970;60003970;60003970;60020224;60218018,2021,21682267,21100274221,21682275,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9364931,,Excluido por machine learning

We propose an improved Dyna-Q algorithm, which incorporates heuristic search strategies, simulated annealing mechanism, and reactive navigation principle into Q-learning based on the Dyna architecture.

The design and development of a new digital device or system require a good understanding of the embedded system embed in it. In the context of engineering education, learning embedded systems remains a challenge for the millennial. As, it involves the implementation of mathematics, programming, and working knowledge of electronic and electrical components rooted in it. Traditional teaching pedagogy has become less useful for new-gen learners to satisfy their demand for knowledge of embedded systems. So, the teaching techniques have to be modified and equipped with the latest technological tools and practices. Augmented reality (AR) is emerging as a new technology in the field of engineering education. With the help of computer-generated 3D data, animation, visual effects, and immersion, this technology has become more prevalent in the education domain to make complex concepts easier to understand. In this paper, an augmented reality-based framework designed to teach embedded systems to engineering students. The proposed framework utilizes a tangible user interface comprising of AR markers, a USB camera, a display device, and the processing unit to give AR learning experience to the students.

NO,10.1109/TASE.2020.2984739,A Method Integrating Q-Learning with Approximate Dynamic Programming for Gantry Work Cell Scheduling,"This article formulates gantry real-time scheduling in a gantry work cell, where the material transfer is driven by gantries, as a Markov decision process (MDP). Classical learning methods and planning methods for solving the optimization problems in MDP are discussed. An innovative method, called 'Q-ADP,' is proposed to integrate reinforcement learning (RL) with approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Q-ADP uses model-free Q-learning algorithm to learn state values through interactions with the environment, meanwhile, planning steps during the learning process opt for ADP to keep updating state values through several sample paths. A model of one-step transition probabilities is built based on the machines' reliability model, and serves the ADP algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, a numerical study is performed to show the production performance, compared to a standard Q-learning algorithm. The simulation results show that Q-ADP outperforms standard Q-learning under the same length of training process. It is also shown that with the benefit of repeated updating state values through sample paths, Q-ADP requires less data for gantry policy to converge, which makes the method promising when real data are limited. Note to Practitioners - The goal of this work is to find a near optimal gantry assignment policy to realize real-time control of material handling gantry/robot movements in gantry work cells. Properly assigning gantries based on real-time situations of the production system can avoid machines' stoppage due to material shortage, and consequently improve production performance. This gantry scheduling is a sequential decision-making problem and can be presented by Markov Decision Process (MDP). To solve the MDP problem, an algorithm integrating model-free Q-learning and model-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed. By learning directly from the interaction with the environment, the method avoids bias problem from any model designing. Meanwhile, a planning process during learning can efficiently speed up the learning for convergence of the policy, and this particularly benefits to the scenario when the real data are insufficient.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) | gantry scheduling | Markov decision process (MDP) | planning and learning | Q-learning,2-s2.0-85094140525,,,Article,Ou X.,60026415;60021918,Stony Brook University;University of Virginia,Stony Brook;Charlottesville,United States;United States,3,"Ou, Xinyan;Chang, Qing;Chakraborty, Nilanjan",57190300444;57217724791;35190154200,60026415;60021918;60026415,January 2021,15455955,17340,15583783,Journal,18,1,9069276,85-93,0,NSF,CMMI 1351160,National Science Foundation,6,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9069276,,Excluido porque no tiene nada qeu ver con educación

In this work, in order to improve routing performance of the system, such as routing runtime and power consumption, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)based core placement optimization approach, considering application constraints, such as deadlock caused by multicast paths. We leverage the capability of deep RL from indirect supervision as a direct nonlinear optimizer, and the parameters of the policy network are updated by proximal policy optimization. We treat the routing topology as a network graph, so we utilize a graph convolutional network to embed the features into the policy network. One step size environment is designed, so all cores are placed simultaneously. To handle large dimensional action space, we use continuous values matching with the number of cores as the output of the policy network and discretize them again for obtaining the new placement. For multichip system mapping, we developed a community detection algorithm. We use several datasets of multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks to evaluate our agent. We compare the optimal results obtained by our agent with other baselines under different multicast conditions. Our approach achieves a significant reduction of routing runtime, communication cost, and average traffic load, along with deadlock-free performance for inner chip data transmission. The traffic of interchip routing is also significantly reduced after integrating the community detection algorithm to our agent.",ar,2021-01-01,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Community detection algorithm | deadlock-free placement | Neural networks | Optimization | physical mapping | Power demand | reinforcement learning (RL). | Routing | System recovery | Topology | Training,2-s2.0-85117278393,,,Article,Myung W.,60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,5,"Myung, Wooshik;Lee, Donghyun;Song, Chenhang;Wang, Guanrui;Ma, Cheng",57216852746;57309396800;57299320400;57201775278;8914125600,60025278;60025278;60025278;60025278;60025278,2021,2162237X,21100235616,21622388,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9570134,,Excluido por machine learning

NO,10.1109/TRO.2020.3006716,Motion Planning Networks: Bridging the Gap between Learning-Based and Classical Motion Planners,"This article describes motion planning networks (MPNet), a computationally efficient, learning-based neural planner for solving motion planning problems.MPNet uses neural networks to learn general near-optimal heuristics for path planning in seen and unseen environments. It takes environment information such as raw point cloud from depth sensors, as well as a robot's initial and desired goal configurations and recursively calls itself to bidirectionally generate connectable paths. In addition to finding directly connectable and near-optimal paths in a single pass, we show that worst-case theoretical guarantees can be proven if we merge this neural network strategy with classical sample-based planners in a hybrid approach while still retaining significant computational and optimality improvements. To train the MPNet models, we present an active continual learning approach that enables MPNet to learn from streaming data and actively ask for expert demonstrations when needed, drastically reducing data for training. We validate MPNet against gold-standard and state-of-the-art planning methods in a variety of problems from two-dimensional to seven-dimensional robot configuration spaces in challenging and cluttered environments, with results showing significant and consistently stronger performance metrics, and motivating neural planning in general as a modern strategy for solving motion planning problems efficiently.",ar,2021-02-01,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,Deep learning in robotics and automation | learning and adaptive systems | learning from demonstration | motion and path planning,2-s2.0-85100980709,,,Article,Qureshi A.H.,60030612;60022195,"University of California, San Diego;Massachusetts Institute of Technology",San Diego;Cambridge,United States;United States,4,"Qureshi, Ahmed Hussain;Miao, Yinglong;Simeonov, Anthony;Yip, Michael C.",55849495300;57219691543;57201114672;35868173800,60030612;60030612;60022195;60030612,February 2021,15523098,95101,19410468,Journal,37,1,9154607,48-66,0,NSF,1935329,National Science Foundation,11,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9154607,,Excluido por machine learning

Java is the most common platform for embedded applications such as IoT, Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN), Near Field Communications (NFC) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The object programming languages such as Java, SWIFT, PHP and C++ use garbage collection after any object run which creates security loophole for attacks such as Next Memory Address Occupation (NMAO), memory replay, Learning Tasks Behaviors (LTB). The security risk increases in IoT when attacks exceeds the target device to the surrounding connected devices. Inappropriate or wrong operations causes energy loss and increased costs. In this paper, a security method to protect IoT system operation from memory heap penetration and address modification attack is proposed. The proposed method prevents directed attack by encrypting the object Garbage Collection at run time. To form a unique signature mechanism, the Cryptographic Hash Function (CHF) which employs a specific one-way hash algorithm. The proposed framework uses L-function based ECC and one-time Key (OTK) to secure the memory heap. Our method is used with open system where the effect on the operating system is not considered.

NO,10.1016/j.robot.2020.103693,LOOP: Iterative learning for optimistic planning on robots,"Efficient robotic behaviors require robustness and adaptation to dynamic changes of the environment, whose characteristics rapidly vary during robot operation. To generate effective robot action policies, planning and learning techniques have shown the most promising results. However, if considered individually, they present different limitations. Planning techniques lack generalization among similar states and require experts to define behavioral routines at different levels of abstraction. Conversely, learning methods usually require a considerable number of training samples and iterations of the algorithm. To overcome these issues, and to efficiently generate robot behaviors, we introduce LOOP, an iterative learning algorithm for optimistic planning that combines state-of-the-art planning and learning techniques to generate action policies. The main contribution of LOOP is the combination of Monte-Carlo Search Planning and Q-learning, which enables focused exploration during policy refinement in different robotic applications.

Numerous studies have been performed that attempt to examine the effects of using tangible interfaces to enhance collaborative learning experiences. In most of these studies, feedback, which is a vital function for a successful game activity, is mainly provided by the trainers. However, this kind of feedback can be considered as static and general, while each trainee seeks clear, consistent, and even personalized feedback. This article proposes an interactive learning tool for introducing algorithmic thinking and sequencing using educational robots suitable for elementary and intermediate students. In more detail, in this article, we leverage a fuzzy-rule-based system and computer vision techniques to provide immediate, personalized feedback and recommendations to young students while they perform a series of activities using tangible robots. These activities relate to teaching programming skills and improve the algorithmic thinking of students. Experimental results revealed that participants were able to increase their algorithmic/programming thinking skills while developing a positive attitude toward programming. The interactive gaming factor that is embedded in the use of tangible robots, while participating in the activities, was proved to be a compelling and a rewarding experience.

NO,10.3390/s21041322,Emotion detection for social robots based on nlp transformers and an emotion ontology,"For social robots, knowledge regarding human emotional states is an essential part of adapting their behavior or associating emotions to other entities. Robots gather the information from which emotion detection is processed via different media, such as text, speech, images, or videos. The multimedia content is then properly processed to recognize emotions/sentiments, for example, by analyzing faces and postures in images/videos based on machine learning techniques or by converting speech into text to perform emotion detection with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Keeping this information in semantic repositories offers a wide range of possibilities for implementing smart applications. We propose a framework to allow social robots to detect emotions and to store this information in a semantic repository, based on EMONTO (an EMotion ONTOlogy), and in the first figure or table caption. Please define if appropriate. an ontology to represent emotions. As a proof-of-concept, we develop a first version of this framework focused on emotion detection in text, which can be obtained directly as text or by converting speech to text. We tested the implementation with a case study of tour-guide robots for museums that rely on a speech-to-text converter based on the Google Application Programming Interface (API) and a Python library, a neural network to label the emotions in texts based on NLP transformers, and EMONTO integrated with an ontology for museums; thus, it is possible to register the emotions that artworks produce in visitors.

NO,10.1109/TCDS.2020.2968056,A Framework of Hybrid Force/Motion Skills Learning for Robots,"Human factors and human-centered design philosophy are highly desired in today's robotics applications such as human-robot interaction (HRI). Several studies showed that endowing robots of human-like interaction skills can not only make them more likeable but also improve their performance. In particular, skill transfer by imitation learning can increase the usability and acceptability of robots by users without computer programming skills. In fact, besides positional information, muscle stiffness of the human arm and contact force with the environment also play important roles in understanding and generating human-like manipulation behaviors for robots, e.g., in physical HRI and teleoperation. To this end, we present a novel robot learning framework based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), taking into consideration both the positional and contact force profiles for human-robot skills transferring. Distinguished from the conventional method involving only the motion information, the proposed framework combines two sets of DMPs, which are built to model the motion trajectory and the force variation of the robot manipulator, respectively. Thus, a hybrid force/motion control approach is taken to ensure the accurate tracking and reproduction of the desired positional and force motor skills. Meanwhile, in order to simplify the control system, a momentum-based force observer is applied to estimate the contact force instead of employing force sensors. To deploy the learned motion-force robot manipulation skills to a broader variety of tasks, the generalization of these DMP models in actual situations is also considered. Comparative experiments have been conducted using a Baxter robot to verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework on real-world scenarios like cleaning a table.",ar,2021-03-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) | force observer | generalization | hybrid force/motion control | robot learning | skill transfer,2-s2.0-85102768405,,,Article,Wang N.,60032204;60024542;60019611,Sheffield Hallam University;South China University of Technology;University of the West of England,Sheffield;Guangzhou;Bristol,United Kingdom;China;United Kingdom,3,"Wang, Ning;Chen, Chuize;Nuovo, Alessandro Di",55446268900;57203137144;56962754700,60019611;60024542;60032204,March 2021,23798920,21100784665,23798939,Journal,13,1,8964480,162-170,0,EPSRC,EP/P030033/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,6,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8964480,,Excluido por machine learning

The concept consists primarily of a user-friendly software facilitating direct communication with any intelligent or learning system/robot operating under known parameters of motor specifications. Any software base permitting high level PC interface without ASCII interrupt can be used for easy programming. This allows for a learning operation mode where a prevention of time lag is enabled by stored machine data, captured through movements such movements can be physically made or taught via programs to the device and such learning aspects make the machine more efficient where the robot can either perform individual actions as needed or learn new methods for the same results and can perform a series of actions continuously. Using the stored data, the machine is also capable of autonomous movements based on the path of least resistance as calculated by the time it takes to perform an act. Interfacing Technique Tool Machining Robot (ITTMR) was developed as robotic tool holder that can determine the shape and size of different OCTG pipes utilized in the downhole industry and enable it to machine appropriate threads on the pipe with no manual intervention. The process thereby completely negates any possibility of human error which can otherwise cause heavy loss on finished equipment that are rendered unusable because of threading errors on almost nearly finished complex milled parts or assemblies that are pending threads as the final operation.

NO,10.1108/IR-01-2020-0010,Effectiveness of multi-gated sequence model for the learning of kinematics and dynamics of an industrial robot,"Purpose: For efficient trajectory control of industrial robots, a cumbersome computation for inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics is needed, which is usually developed using spatial transformation using Denavit–Hartenberg principle and Lagrangian or Newton–Euler methods, respectively. The model is highly non-linear and needs to deal with uncertainties because of lack of accurate measurement of mechanical parameters, noise and non-inclusion of joint friction, which results in some inaccuracies in predicting accurate torque trajectories. To get a guaranteed closed form solution, the robot designers normally follow Pieper’s recommendation and compromise with the mechanical design. While this may be acceptable for the industrial robots where the aesthetic look is not that important, it is not for humanoid and social robots. To help solve this problem, this study aims to propose an alternative machine learning-based computational approach based on a multi-gated sequence model for finding appropriate mapping between Cartesian space to joint space and motion space to joint torque space. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors generate sufficient data required for the sequence model, using forward kinematics and forward dynamics by running N number of nested loops, where N is the number of joints of the robot. Subsequently, to develop a learning-based model based on sequence analysis, the authors propose to use long short-term memory (LSTM) and hence, train an LSTM model, the architecture details of which have been discussed in the paper. To make LSTM learning algorithms perform efficiently, the authors need to detect and eliminate redundant features from the data set, which the authors propose to do using an elegant statistical tool called Pearson coefficient. Findings: To validate the proposed model, the authors have performed rigorous experiments using both hardware and simulation robots (Baxter/Anukul robot) available in their laboratory and KUKA simulation robot data set made available from Neural Learning for Robotics Laboratory. Through several characteristic plots, it has been shown that a sequence-based LSTM model of deep learning architecture with non-redundant features could help the robots to learn smooth and accurate trajectories more quickly compared to data sets having redundancy. Such data-driven modeling techniques can change the future course of direction of robotics research for solving the classical problems such as trajectory planning and motion planning for manipulating industrial as well as social humanoid robots. Originality/value: The present investigation involves development of deep learning-based computation model, statistical analyses to eliminate redundant features, data creation from one hardware robot (Anukul) and one simulation robot model (KUKA), rigorously training and testing separately two computational models (specially configured two LSTM models) – one for learning inverse kinematics and one for learning inverse dynamics problem – and comparison of the inverse dynamics model with the state-of-the-art model.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3060408,Robust Policy Search for Robot Navigation,"Complex robot navigation and control problems can be framed as policy search problems. However, interactive learning in uncertain environments can be expensive, requiring the use of data-efficient methods. Bayesian optimization is an efficient nonlinear optimization method where queries are carefully selected to gather information about the optimum location. This is achieved by a surrogate model, which encodes past information, and the acquisition function for query selection. Bayesian optimization can be very sensitive to uncertainty in the input data or prior assumptions. In this letter, we incorporate both robust optimization and statistical robustness, showing that both types of robustness are synergistic. For robust optimization we use an improved version of unscented Bayesian optimization which provides safe and repeatable policies in the presence of policy uncertainty.

NO,10.1109/JPROC.2021.3063154,Learning-Based Automation of Robotic Assembly for Smart Manufacturing,"For smart manufacturing, an automated robotic assembly system built upon an autoprogramming environment is necessary to reduce setup time and cost for robots that are engaged in frequent task reassignment. This article presents an approach to the autoprogramming of robotic assembly tasks with minimal human assistance. The approach integrates 'robotic learning of assembly tasks from observation' and 'robotic embodiment of learned assembly tasks in the form of skills.' In the former, robots observe human assembly operations to learn a sequence of assembly tasks, which is formalized into a human assembly script. The latter transforms the human assembly script into a robot assembly script in which a sequence of robot-executable assembly tasks are defined based on action planning supported by workspace modeling and simulated retargeting. The assembly tasks, in the form of the robot assembly script, are then implemented via pretrained robot skills. These skills aim to enable robots to execute difficult tasks that involve inherent uncertainties and variations. We validate the proposed approach by building a prototype of the automated robotic assembly system for a power breaker and an electronic set-top box. The results verify that the proposed automated robotic assembly system is not only feasible but also viable, as it is associated with a dramatic reduction in the human effort required for automating robotic assembly.",ar,2021-04-01,Proceedings of the IEEE,Automated robot programming | learning by observation | smart manufacturing,2-s2.0-85103333065,,,Article,Ji S.,60080940;60032144;60024872;60013682;60007511;60006245,Korea Institute of Industrial Technology;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;Hanyang University;Seoul National University;Sungkyunkwan University;Kookmin University,Cheonan;Daejeon;Seoul;Seoul;Seoul;Seoul,South Korea;South Korea;South Korea;South Korea;South Korea;South Korea,8,"Ji, Sanghoon;Lee, Sukhan;Yoo, Sujeong;Suh, Ilhong;Kwon, Inso;Park, Frank C.;Lee, Sanghyoung;Kim, Hongseok",55617057100;7601402085;47062458200;55663194100;7003450602;7005395417;55350211200;57192499191,60080940;60007511;60080940;60024872;60032144;60013682;60080940;60006245,April 2021,189219,17915,15582256,Journal,109,4,9383829,423-440,1,MOTIE,2019-0-00421,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy",5,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9383829,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3061073,Learning Interaction-Aware Trajectory Predictions for Decentralized Multi-Robot Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments,"This letter presents a data-driven decentralized trajectory optimization approach for multi-robot motion planning in dynamic environments. When navigating in a shared space, each robot needs accurate motion predictions of neighboring robots to achieve predictive collision avoidance. These motion predictions can be obtained among robots by sharing their future planned trajectories with each other via communication. However, such communication may not be available nor reliable in practice. In this letter, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that can learn multi-robot motion behaviors from demonstrated trajectories generated using a centralized sequential planner. The learned model can run efficiently online for each robot and provide interaction-aware trajectory predictions of its neighbors based on observations of their history states. We then incorporate the trajectory prediction model into a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) framework for multi-robot collision avoidance. Simulation results show that our decentralized approach can achieve a comparable level of performance to a centralized planner while being communication-free and scalable to a large number of robots. We also validate our approach with a team of quadrotors in real-world experiments.",ar,2021-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Deep learning methods | motion and path planning | path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents,2-s2.0-85101732326,,,Article,Zhu H.,60118240,"Department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft",Delft,Netherlands,4,"Zhu, Hai;Claramunt, Francisco Martinez;Brito, Bruno;Alonso-Mora, Javier",57205189246;57222261283;57211022915;37057150200,60118240;60118240;60118240;60118240,April 2021,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,6,2,9360433,2256-2263,0,NWO,15916,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,1,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9360433,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3063989,Reachability-Based Trajectory Safeguard (RTS): A Safe and Fast Reinforcement Learning Safety Layer for Continuous Control,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have achieved remarkable performance in decision making and control tasks by reasoning about long-term, cumulative reward using trial and error. However, during RL training, applying this trial-and-error approach to real-world robots operating in safety critical environment may lead to collisions. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a Reachability-based Trajectory Safeguard (RTS), which leverages reachability analysis to ensure safety during training and operation. Given a known (but uncertain) model of a robot, RTS precomputes a Forward Reachable Set of the robot tracking a continuum of parameterized trajectories. At runtime, the RL agent selects from this continuum in a receding-horizon way to control the robot; the FRS is used to identify if the agent's choice is safe or not, and to adjust unsafe choices. The efficacy of this method is illustrated in static environments on three nonlinear robot models, including a 12-D quadrotor drone, in simulation and in comparison with state-of-the-art safe motion planning methods.",ar,2021-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Reinforcement learning | robot safety | task and motion planning,2-s2.0-85102305776,,,Article,Shao Y.S.,60025778;60012708,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;Stanford University",Ann Arbor;Palo Alto,United States;United States,4,"Shao, Yifei Simon;Chen, Chao;Kousik, Shreyas;Vasudevan, Ram",57221253693;57222320947;57220203733;57213570482,60025778;60025778;60012708;60025778,April 2021,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,6,2,9369910,3663-3670,0,NSF,N022977,National Science Foundation,2,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9369910,,Excuido por machine learning

NO,10.1007/s11370-021-00363-w,Coordination of multi-robot path planning for warehouse application using smart approach for identifying destinations,"Path planning and coordination in a multi-robot system are important and complex tasks in any environment. In a multi-robot system, there can be multiple objectives to be achieved by multiple robots simultaneously. Nowadays, many mobile service robots are being used in warehouses to reduce running costs and overheads. In a large warehouse, there can be multiple robots to handle the number of operations. Planning a path means to find out the optimal route, and coordinating them means a collision-free route. To get both the parameters to reach their optimal level becomes a tedious task to achieve. The efficiency of overall warehouse operation can be improved by adequately addressing the coordination and path planning issues among the robots. In warehouses, each robot has to navigate to its destination by finding a collision-free optimal route in coordination with other robots. In this paper, a comparative study with the acclaimed path planning and coordination has been presented. The proposed smart approach has been presented for a multi-robot system to find a collision-free optimal path in a warehouse to handle storage pods. This paper proposes a smart distance metric-based approach for a multi-robot system to identify their goals smartly and traverse only a minimal path to reach their goal without getting being collided. It uses a smart distance metric-based approach to find the intended path. The proposed work performs better when compared with other works like A* and ILP. It is strictly monitored that there is no collision occurred during execution. Three different instances of a warehouse have been considered to carry out the experiments with parameters such as path length, average path and elapsed time. The experiments with 800 pods and 16 robots report the improvement in performance up to 2.5% and 13% in average path length and elapsed time.",ar,2021-04-01,Intelligent Service Robotics,Coordination | Multi-robot | Path planning | Warehouse,2-s2.0-85103394440,,,Article,Sharma K.,60104578,National Institute of Technology Raipur,Raipur,India,2,"Sharma, Kaushlendra;Doriya, Rajesh",57207403333;54917442000,60104578;60104578,April 2021,18612776,9500154152,18612784,Journal,14,2,,313-325,0,,undefined,,1,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11370-021-00363-w,,Excluido por nada que ver (manufacturing)

Existing approaches only learn discrete, short-horizon behaviors. These standalone behaviors usually assume a discrete action space with simple robot dynamics, thus they cannot capture the intricacy and complexity of real-world trajectories. To this end, we propose Composable Behavior Embedding (CBE), a continuous behavior representation for long-horizon visual navigation.

We show that CBE can be used to performing memory-efficient path following and topological mapping, saving more than an order of magnitude of memory than behavior-less approaches.",ar,2021-04-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Deep learning for visual perception | learning from demonstration | vision-based navigation,2-s2.0-85101732865,,,Article,Meng X.,60076695;60015481,NVIDIA;University of Washington,Santa Clara;Seattle,United States;United States,3,"Meng, Xiangyun;Xiang, Yu;Fox, Dieter",57206248077;57208149183;7402074129,60015481;60076695;60015481,April 2021,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,6,2,9359335,3128-3135,0,ONR,63-6094,Office of Naval Research,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9359335,,Excluido por machine learning

Meanwhile, the high-level MPFC exploits the linearized system model augmented with a virtual linear path dynamics model to optimize the evolution of path reference targets, and provides the reference states and controls for the low-level LB-FBLC.

SI,10.1007/s10798-019-09559-9,The influence of SRA programming on algorithmic thinking and self-efficacy using Lego robotics in two types of instruction,"This study investigates the development of algorithmic thinking as a part of computational thinking skills and self-efficacy of primary school pupils using programmable robots in different instruction variants. Computational thinking is defined in the context of twenty-first century skills and describes processes involved in (re)formulating a problem in a way that a computer can process it. Programming robots offers specific affordances as it can be used to develop programs following a Sense-Reason-Act (SRA) cycle. The literature provides evidence that programming robots has the potential to enhance algorithmic thinking as a component of computational thinking. Specifically there are indications that pupils who use SRA-programming learn algorithmic skills better and achieve a higher level of self-efficacy in an open, scaffold learning environment than through direct instruction. In order to determine the influence of the instruction variant used, an experimental research design was made in which pupils solved algorithm-based mathematical problems (grid diagrams) in a preliminary measurement and their self-efficacy determined via a questionnaire. As an intervention, pupils learn to solve programming issues in pairs using “Lego NXT” robots and “Mindstorms” software in two instruction variants. The post-measurement consists of a Lego challenge, solving mathematical problems (grid diagrams), and a repeated self-efficacy questionnaire. This research shows an increase of our measures on algorithmic thinking dependent on the amount of SRA usage (though not significant). Programming using the SRA-cycle can be considered as the cause of the measured effect.

To reduce the cognitive workload of the operator, the robot should not only be able to learn from experience but also to plan and decide autonomously. Here, we present an approach based on Dynamic Neural Fields that apply brain-like computations to endow a robot with these cognitive functions. A neural integrator is used to model the gradual accumulation of sensory and other evidence as time-varying persistent activity of neural populations. The decision to act is modeled by a competitive dynamics between neural populations linked to different motor behaviors. They receive the persistent activation pattern of the integrators as input. In the first experiment, a robot learns rapidly by observation the sequential order of object transfers between an assistant and an operator to subsequently substitute the assistant in the joint task. The results show that the robot is able to proactively plan the series of handovers in the correct order. In the second experiment, a mobile robot searches at two different workbenches for a specific object to deliver it to an operator. The object may appear at the two locations in a certain time period with independent probabilities unknown to the robot. The trial-by-trial decision under uncertainty is biased by the accumulated evidence of past successes and choices.

Autonomous mobile manipulation presents a hurdle prior to safely using robots in real-life applications. In this article, we introduce a mobile manipulation framework based on model predictive control using learned dynamics models of objects. We focus on the specific problem of manipulating legged objects such as those commonly found in healthcare environments and personal dwellings (e.g., walkers, tables, chairs). We describe a probabilistic method for autonomous learning of an approximate dynamics model for these objects. In this method, we learn dynamic parameters using a small dataset consisting of force and motion data from interactions between the robot and object. Moreover, we account for multiple manipulation strategies by formulating manipulation planning as a mixed-integer convex optimization. The proposed framework considers the hybrid control system composed of (i) choosing which leg to grasp and (ii) control of continuous applied forces for manipulation. We formalize our algorithm based on model predictive control to compensate for modeling errors and find an optimal path to manipulate the object from one configuration to another. We present results for several objects with various wheel configurations.

To provide a baseline solution for the performance evaluation of the proposed solution, we first develop a theoretical analysis for the minimum time-energy path planning problem in a known environment using the Pontryagin's minimum principle. We then provide an online adaptive solution in an unknown environment using IRL. This is done through transforming the minimum time-energy problem to an approximate minimum time-energy problem and then developing an IRL-based optimal control strategy. Convergence of the IRL-based optimal control strategy is proven. Simulation studies are developed to compare the theoretical analysis and the proposed IRL-based algorithm.",ar,2021-04-01,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,constrained optimal control | integral reinforcement learning | minimum time-energy path planning,2-s2.0-85092146703,,,Article,He C.,60003467;125193442,The University of Texas at Arlington;EE UTA and UTA Research Institute,Arlington;,United States;United States,4,"He, Chenyuan;Wan, Yan;Gu, Yixin;Lewis, Frank L.",57201378440;57200168239;56764960200;57208457500,60003467;125193442;60003467;125193442,April 2021,10498923,17987,10991239,Journal,31,6,,1905-1922,1,NSF,1714519,National Science Foundation,5,2021,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rnc.5122,,Exlcluido por machine learning

The proposal improves classical motion planning algorithms by introducing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach trained ad hoc for performing obstacle avoidance, while achieving a reaching task in the operative space. More specifically, a switching mechanism is enabled whenever a condition of proximity to the obstacles is met, thus conferring to the dual-mode architecture a self-configuring capability in order to cope with objects unexpectedly invading the workspace.

NO,10.1007/s10994-020-05934-z,Learning programs by learning from failures,"We describe an inductive logic programming (ILP) approach called learning from failures. In this approach, an ILP system (the learner) decomposes the learning problem into three separate stages: generate, test, and constrain. In the generate stage, the learner generates a hypothesis (a logic program) that satisfies a set of hypothesis constraints (constraints on the syntactic form of hypotheses). In the test stage, the learner tests the hypothesis against training examples. A hypothesis fails when it does not entail all the positive examples or entails a negative example. If a hypothesis fails, then, in the constrain stage, the learner learns constraints from the failed hypothesis to prune the hypothesis space, i.e. to constrain subsequent hypothesis generation. For instance, if a hypothesis is too general (entails a negative example), the constraints prune generalisations of the hypothesis. If a hypothesis is too specific (does not entail all the positive examples), the constraints prune specialisations of the hypothesis. This loop repeats until either (i) the learner finds a hypothesis that entails all the positive and none of the negative examples, or (ii) there are no more hypotheses to test. We introduce Popper, an ILP system that implements this approach by combining answer set programming and Prolog. Popper supports infinite problem domains, reasoning about lists and numbers, learning textually minimal programs, and learning recursive programs. Our experimental results on three domains (toy game problems, robot strategies, and list transformations) show that (i) constraints drastically improve learning performance, and (ii) Popper can outperform existing ILP systems, both in terms of predictive accuracies and learning times.",ar,2021-04-01,Machine Learning,Inductive logic programming | Program induction | Program synthesis,2-s2.0-85100995523,,,Article,Cropper A.,60026851,University of Oxford,Oxford,United Kingdom,2,"Cropper, Andrew;Morel, Rolf",56453185100;57208863222,60026851;60026851,April 2021,8856125,24775,15730565,Journal,110,4,,801-856,1,GTC,undefined,"Green Templeton College, University of Oxford",2,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-020-05934-z,,Excluido por machine learning

In this work, we propose to uniquely leverage natural language descriptions from the mission commander in chief and image data captured by robots to estimate scene danger. Given a description and an image, a state-of-the-art deep neural network is used to assess a corresponding similarity score, which is then converted into a probabilistic distribution of danger levels. Because commonly used visio-linguistic datasets do not represent SaR missions well, we collect a large-scale image-description dataset from synthetic images taken from realistic disaster scenes and use it to train our machine learning model. A risk-aware variant of the Multi-robot Efficient Search Path Planning (MESPP) problem is then formulated to use the danger estimates in order to account for high-risk locations in the environment when planning the searchers' paths. The problem is solved via a distributed approach based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming.

Educational robotics provide students with the opportunity to collaborate in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) oriented activities. This study aims to examine the effects of robotics training on children’s spatial ability and attitude toward STEM. A one-group pretest–posttest design, a type of pre-experimental design, was used in the study. The participants were 39 elementary school students (34 boys and 5 girls aged 8–12) who participated in a long-term (31 weeks) robotics course. The course had four main learning objectives related to STEM fields: mechanical design, electronics, algorithms, and robotics programming. The spatial visualization and mental rotation tests were used to determine the children’s spatial ability. The STEM attitude scale was used to reveal their attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and related twenty-first century skills. Data were analyzed using t-test and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. According to the findings, the children’s spatial visualization and mental rotation test scores were significantly increased at the end of the course. Moreover, the children’s attitudes toward STEM were significantly improved. The results showed that educational robotics may improve children’s spatial ability and attitudes toward STEM.

This challenge becomes more applicable in micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their limited size and computational power. This paper presents a novel approach for enabling a micro aerial vehicle system equipped with a laser range finder to autonomously navigate among obstacles and achieve a user-specified goal location in a GPS-denied environment, without the need for mapping or path planning. The proposed system uses an actor–critic-based reinforcement learning technique to train the aerial robot in a Gazebo simulator to perform a point-goal navigation task by directly mapping the noisy MAV’s state and laser scan measurements to continuous motion control. The obtained policy can perform collision-free flight in the real world while being trained entirely on a 3D simulator. Intensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted and compared with a nonlinear model predictive control technique to show the generalization capabilities to new unseen environments, and robustness against localization noise.

However, most visual SLAM or VO cannot meet the accuracy requirements in dynamic indoor environments. This paper proposes a robust visual odometry based on deep learning to eliminate feature points matching error. However, when a camera and dynamic objects are in relative motion, the frames of camera will produce ghosting, especially in high-dynamic environments, which bring additional positioning error; in view of this problem, a novel method based on the average optical flow value of the dynamic region is proposed to identify feature points of the ghosting, and then the feature points of the ghosting and dynamic region are removed. After the remaining feature points are matched, we use a non-linear optimization method to calculate the pose. The proposed algorithm is tested on TUM RGB-D dataset, and the results show that our VO improves the positioning accuracy than other robust SLAM or VO and is strongly robust especially in high-dynamic environments.",ar,2021-04-01,Measurement Science and Technology,Deep learning | Dynamic indoor environments | Ghosting | Optical flow histogram | Rgb-d camera | Visual odometry,2-s2.0-85101856603,,,Article,Zhang F.,60018554,Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou,China,4,"Zhang, Fangfang;Li, Qiyan;Wang, Tingting;Ma, Tianlei",57219132849;57218913201;56155357100;55903961400,60018554;60018554;60018554;60018554,April 2021,9570233,15526,13616501,Journal,32,4,44003,,0,,undefined,,2,2021,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/abcc15,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.3390/s21082577,Coverage path planning using reinforcement learning-based tsp for htetran — A polyabolo-inspired self-reconfigurable tiling robot,"One of the critical challenges in deploying the cleaning robots is the completion of covering the entire area. Current tiling robots for area coverage have fixed forms and are limited to cleaning only certain areas. The reconfigurable system is the creative answer to such an optimal coverage problem. The tiling robot’s goal enables the complete coverage of the entire area by reconfiguring to different shapes according to the area’s needs. In the particular sequencing of navigation, it is essential to have a structure that allows the robot to extend the coverage range while saving energy usage during navigation. This implies that the robot is able to cover larger areas entirely with the least required actions. This paper presents a complete path planning (CPP) for hTetran, a polyabolo tiled robot, based on a TSP-based reinforcement learning optimization. This structure simultaneously produces robot shapes and sequential trajectories whilst maximizing the reward of the trained reinforcement learning (RL) model within the predefined polyabolo-based tileset. To this end, a reinforcement learning-based travel sales problem (TSP) with proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm was trained using the complementary learning computation of the TSP sequencing. The reconstructive results of the proposed RL-TSP-based CPP for hTetran were compared in terms of energy and time spent with the conventional tiled hypothetical models that incorporate TSP solved through an evolutionary based ant colony optimization (ACO) approach. The CPP demonstrates an ability to generate an ideal Pareto optima trajectory that enhances the robot’s navigation inside the real environment with the least energy and time spent in the company of conventional techniques.",ar,2021-04-02,Sensors,"Energy-aware reward function | Reconfigurable system | Reinforcement learning TSP, complete path planning | Tiling robotic",2-s2.0-85103558380,,33916995,Article,Le A.V.,60104290;60078563;120457942,Singapore University of Technology and Design;Ton-Duc-Thang University;Yangon Technological University,;Ho Chi Minh City;Yangon,Singapore;Viet Nam;Myanmar,5,"Le, Anh Vu;Veerajagadheswar, Prabakaran;Kyaw, Phone Thiha;Elara, Mohan Rajesh;Nhan, Nguyen Huu Khanh",57203354430;57202515803;57219910636;36456051800;57191342556,60104290-60078563;60104290;120457942;60104290;60078563,2 April 2021,14248220,130124,,Journal,21,8,2577,,1,A*STAR,192 22 00058,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research",5,2021,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/8/2577,,Excluido por machine learning

In this paper, a jumping mechanism particle swarm optimization (JPSO) algorithm and a safety gap obstacle avoidance algorithm (SGOA) algorithm were proposed. Compared with canonical PSO algorithm, JPSO algorithm has three improvement strategies: Fitness value evaluation function, new learning sample and jumping strategy. The JPSO algorithm updates the particles with poor comprehensive quality by jumping and adjusts the inertia weight adaptively according to fitness value evaluation function. With the cooperation of new learning samples, the global searching ability and precision of the algorithm can be improved. SGOA algorithm is mainly aimed at the problem that robots with low priority are stuck in a long wait and cannot continue to walk when avoiding obstacles. By implementing the SGOA algorithm, a new collision-free safety path can be optimized for the robot with low priority. In order to verify JPSO and SGOA algorithm, a lot of experiments were done. JPSO algorithm was compared with two other improved PSO algorithms with 6 standard test functions. The path planning and obstacle avoidance experiments of six robots were realized using the JPSO and SGOA algorithm. The experimental results show that JPSO algorithm has higher accuracy and faster convergence speed than the other two improved PSO algorithms, and SGOA algorithm can solve the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem in the path planning of multiple robots well.",ar,2021-05-01,Future Generation Computer Systems,Dynamic obstacle avoidance | Jumping mechanism | Multi-robot path planning | Safety gap | Wireless sensor network,2-s2.0-85098942830,S0167739X20330740,,Article,Tian S.,60073691;60029306,South-Central University for Nationalities;Wuhan University,Wuhan;Wuhan,China;China,4,"Tian, Shasha;Li, Yuanxiang;Kang, Yilin;Xia, Jiening",57191194282;56295391600;36662365900;56009940300,60029306-60073691;60029306;60073691;60029306,May 2021,0167739X,12264,,Journal,118,,,37-47,0,NSFC,BZY18008,National Natural Science Foundation of China,9,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X20330740?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1016/j.cie.2021.107173,A fast robot path planning algorithm based on bidirectional associative learning,"Fast path planning in unknown environment is important to reduce the loss of human and material resources. To reduce planning time while obtaining a short path, this paper proposes a Bidirectional Associative Learning Algorithm (BALA). In the proposed algorithm, an episode is defined as a bidirectional movement between the start point and the target point. The planning process in the BALA is divided into three stages: early stage, medium stage and end stage. In the early stage, the attraction of the target point is adopted to instruct the robot to select action. This strategy not only helps the robot avoid blind search, but also provides the search scope that may contain the global shortest path for the subsequent episodes. In the medium stage, we propose an action selection strategy based on the experience guidance, where the experience obtained in the obverse and reverse movements is used alternately to improve the learning efficiency of the robot. In the end stage, a strong connectivity relationship between nodes is defined. Planning by this relationship, the length of the final planned path will be the shortest based on the experience the robot obtains. The comparison results with Q-Learning and its improved algorithm reveal that the BALA demonstrates desirable and stable performance in planning efficiency in any environment, and it can well balance the planning time and path length.

Besides, it is possible for the user, throughout its use, to code in three levels of abstraction: its overly intuitive native programming language called R-Educ, BlockEduc (R-Educ version of Blockly), and C#. Programs can be compiled and interpreted by virtual robots executing any given command. As for teachers, the framework API offers tools that can be employed in the assembly and customization of the learning setup. The whole platform has been built as a tool dedicated to spreading the worlds of Robotics and Programming among youngsters, as well as making them more affordable to everyone. It has been validated by our experiments and is currently being used during the novel Coronavirus pandemic by the official RoboCupJunior Rescue trials in Brazil, currently with more than a thousand competing teams (about 5 thousands students).",ar,2021-05-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,Educational robotics | Learning and programming framework | Robots,2-s2.0-85104660045,,,Article,Nascimento L.M.d.,60023857;112196549,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte;IFRN-Diretoria Educacional de Tecnologia da Gestão e da Informação,Natal;Natal,Brazil;Brazil,7,"Nascimento, Lucas Moura do;Neri, Davi Souto;Ferreira, Thiago do Nascimento;Pereira, Francinaldo de Almeida;Albuquerque, Erika Akemi Yanaguibashi;Gonçalves, Luiz Marcos Garcia;Sá, Sarah Thomaz de Lima",57216058051;57215870557;57215872286;57206167536;57205730944;8843298100;57193607830,60023857;112196549;112196549;60023857;60023857;60023857;112196549,May 2021,9210296,24360,15730409,Journal,102,1,17,,1,CAPES,1,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior,1,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10846-021-01364-8,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVjk6yK7uyFAidlRDQC26x5HFcmgy4lz/view?usp=sharing,"Revisar porque en realidad propone un entorno para programación de robots virtuales, si son puramente virtuales debería excluirlos pero si propone en algún momento usar el mismo framework con robots reales para mí entraría (aunque no estoy seguro)

However, the real-world problems can be studied effectively with the combination of scientific computational techniques with the mathematical models. Automata theory is known to be the popular mathematical model. Towards most of the software and hardware related applications, the computational methods are analyzed and designed using significant automata theory concepts (likely, pushdown automata (PDA), Turing machines (TMs) and finite automata (FA)). Hence, the conventional lecture-driven style has attracted the reflective preferences of learners using these abstract natured concepts. But the lecture-driven teaching style has less motivated the computer engineering learners. In order to learn automata theory and computational models, we introduce the PDA and TM in a virtual platform.

NO,10.1007/s10846-021-01383-5,"The MRS UAV System: Pushing the Frontiers of Reproducible Research, Real-world Deployment, and Education with Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","We present a multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control and estimation system for supporting replicable research through realistic simulations and real-world experiments. We propose a unique multi-frame localization paradigm for estimating the states of a UAV in various frames of reference using multiple sensors simultaneously. The system enables complex missions in GNSS and GNSS-denied environments, including outdoor-indoor transitions and the execution of redundant estimators for backing up unreliable localization sources. Two feedback control designs are presented: one for precise and aggressive maneuvers, and the other for stable and smooth flight with a noisy state estimate. The proposed control and estimation pipeline are constructed without using the Euler/Tait-Bryan angle representation of orientation in 3D. Instead, we rely on rotation matrices and a novel heading-based convention to represent the one free rotational degree-of-freedom in 3D of a standard multirotor helicopter. We provide an actively maintained and well-documented open-source implementation, including realistic simulation of UAV, sensors, and localization systems. The proposed system is the product of years of applied research on multi-robot systems, aerial swarms, aerial manipulation, motion planning, and remote sensing. All our results have been supported by real-world system deployment that subsequently shaped the system into the form presented here. In addition, the system was utilized during the participation of our team from the Czech Technical University in Prague in the prestigious MBZIRC 2017 and 2020 robotics competitions, and also in the DARPA Subterranean challenge.

The development of technologies to help the elderly, so that they can remain active and independent for a longer time, helps to mitigate the sustainability problem posed in care services. This article follows this new trend, proposing a multi-agent system composed of a smart camera network, centralised planning agent, a virtual coach, and robotic exercise buddy, designed to promote regular physical activity habits among the elderly. The proposed system not only persuades the users to perform exercise routines, but also guides and accompanies them during exercises in order to provide effective training and engagement to the user. The different agents are combined in the system to exploit their complementary features in the quest for an effective and engaging training system. Three variants of the system, involving either a partial set of those agents or the full proposed system, were evaluated and compared through a pilot study conducted with 12 elderly users. The results demonstrate that all variants are able to guide the user in an exercise routine, but the most complete system that includes a robotic exercise buddy was the best scored by the participants.

NO,10.11975/j.issn.1002-6819.2021.10.015,Recognition of grape leaf diseases and mobile application based on transfer learning,"Pests and diseases have posed a severe threat to the production of grapes, causing irreversible damage on the growth cycle of grapes. The treatments vary significantly in the types of grape diseases. Therefore, it is highly demanding to detect the diseases of grapes timely, while accurately identify the types of diseases to avoid the spread of diseases. In the early days, the diseases of grapes were mainly identified by experienced grape and pest experts recognizing the grape leaves manually, which is time-consuming and laborious. It is necessary to develop a grape disease recognition using computer science technology. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to automatically recognize agricultural pests in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years. However, the general CNN cannot be well trained to achieve high accuracy, due mainly to few large datasets of diseased grape leaves. In this study, a new recognition network of grape leaf disease was proposed using CNN. Transfer learning and data enhancement were also applied for the new network to enlarge the small dataset of grape leaves. The new network was named Grape-VGG-16 (GV for short) using VGG-16 network (one of the most classical CNN). GV generally contained 5 convolutions, 2 full connection 1 flatten, 1 dropout, and 1 SoftMax layer. The knowledge was first learned from the ImageNet image dataset using transfer learning, and then be transferred to the GV in the disease recognition of grape leaf. The output number was modified to 4 for the last fully connected layer using fine tuning, representing the 4 types of grapes leaves (healthy, brown spot, wheel spot, and black rot). A TensorFlow framework was selected to verify the network in the experiments using Python programming language. 300 images were collected for each leaf category (the total number of images was 1200), 250 of which were randomly selected as the training set, and 50 of which as the testing set. Then the dataset of images was augmented under the operations, such as random rotation, random horizontal and vertical translation, as well as horizontal flipping on the image. Finally, the augmented dataset was used to train the GV network, which was uniformly scaled to 224×224 pixels. 18 groups of experiments were performed on a computing server with Nvidia GPU using a combination of three learning (new learning, transfer learning with training the full connection layer, as well as transfer learning with training both the last convolution and full connection layer), two dataset with/without augmentation, and three learning rates (0.01, 0.001, and 0.000 1). The experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Transfer learning improved the model accuracy, while shortened the convergence time of the model; 2) Data augmentation greatly increased the diversity of data, while effectively alleviated the over-fitting. Consequently, the GV network achieved an overall recognition accuracy of 96.48% under both transfer learning and data augmentation. The recognizing accuracies of healthy leaves, brown spot, wheel spot and black rot were 98.04%, 98.04%, 95.83%, and 94.00%, respectively. The GV network was also embedded in the mobile application, and then deployed on the mobile terminal, for the detection and recognition of grape leaf diseases in the field. The finding can offer a potential promising reference for the intelligent diagnosis of grape leaf diseases in fruit production.",ar,2021-05-15,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,Data augmentation | Diseases | Grape leaf | Image recognition | Mobile terminal | Transfer learning,2-s2.0-85114006903,,,Article,Su S.,60015487,Anhui Agricultural University,Hefei,China,3,"Su, Shifang;Qiao, Yan;Rao, Yuan",57239404500;57239728200;56343988100,60015487;60015487;60015487,15 May 2021,10026819,62499,,Journal,37,10,,127-134,0,,undefined,,1,2021,https://doi.org/10.11975/j.issn.1002-6819.2021.10.015,,Excluido por nada que ver...

NO,10.3390/s21113606,Octopath: An octree-based self-supervised learning approach to local trajectory planning for mobile robots,"Autonomous mobile robots are usually faced with challenging situations when driving in complex environments. Namely, they have to recognize the static and dynamic obstacles, plan the driving path and execute their motion. For addressing the issue of perception and path planning, in this paper, we introduce OctoPath, which is an encoder-decoder deep neural network, trained in a self-supervised manner to predict the local optimal trajectory for the ego-vehicle. Using the discretization provided by a 3D octree environment model, our approach reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification problem with a configurable resolution. During training, OctoPath minimizes the error between the predicted and the manually driven trajectories in a given training dataset. This allows us to avoid the pitfall of regression-based trajectory estimation, in which there is an infinite state space for the output trajectory points. Environment sensing is performed using a 40-channel mechanical LiDAR sensor, fused with an inertial measurement unit and wheels odometry for state estimation. The experiments are performed both in simulation and real-life, using our own developed GridSim simulator and RovisLab’s Autonomous Mobile Test Unit platform. We evaluate the predictions of OctoPath in different driving scenarios, both indoor and outdoor, while benchmarking our system against a baseline hybrid A-Star algorithm and a regression-based supervised learning method, as well as against a CNN learning-based optimal path planning method.",ar,2021-06-01,Sensors,Artificial intelligence | Autonomous vehicles | Deep learning | Mobile robot systems | Path planning | Sensor fusion,2-s2.0-85106340048,,34067237,Article,Trăsnea B.,60023654;126244328,Universitatea Transilvania din Brasov;ELEKTROBIT AUTOMOTIVE ROMANIA SRL,Brasov;Brasov,Romania;Romania,6,"Trăsnea, Bogdan;Ginerică, Cosmin;Zaha, Mihai;Măceşanu, Gigel;Pozna, Claudiu;Grigorescu, Sorin",57195397645;57223847791;57223858779;36601194600;22036026200;55382394500,60023654-126244328;60023654-126244328;60023654-126244328;60023654-126244328;60023654;60023654-126244328,1 June 2021,14248220,130124,,Journal,21,11,3606,,1,H2020,800928,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113606,,Excluido por path planning

NO,10.1109/TCDS.2019.2925890,Autonomous Identification and Goal-Directed Invocation of Event-Predictive Behavioral Primitives,"Voluntary behavior of humans appears to be composed of small, elementary building blocks, or behavioral primitives. While this modular organization seems crucial for the learning of complex motor skills and the flexible adaption of behavior to new circumstances, the problem of learning meaningful, compositional abstractions from sensorimotor experiences remains an open challenge. Here, we introduce a computational learning architecture, termed as surprise-based behavioral modularization into event-predictive structures (SUBMODES) that explores behavior and identifies the underlying behavioral units completely from scratch. The SUBMODES architecture bootstraps sensorimotor exploration using a self-organizing neural controller. While exploring the behavioral capabilities of its own body, the system learns modular structures that predict the sensorimotor dynamics and generate the associated behavior. In line with recent theories of event perception, the system uses unexpected prediction error signals, i.e., surprise, to detect transitions between successive behavioral primitives. We show that, when applied to two robotic systems with completely different body kinematics, the system manages to learn a variety of complex behavioral primitives. Moreover, after initial self exploration the system can use its learned predictive models progressively more effectively for invoking model predictive planning and goal-directed control in different tasks and environments.",ar,2021-06-01,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,Developmental robotics | event cognition | self-organizing behavior | sensorimotor learning | skill acquisition and planning,2-s2.0-85069899151,,,Article,Gumbsch C.,60030569;60017246,Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems;Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen,Tubingen;Tubingen,Germany;Germany,3,"Gumbsch, Christian;Butz, Martin V.;Martius, Georg",57210202534;7003506369;23390010300,60030569-60017246;60017246;60030569,June 2021,23798920,21100784665,23798939,Journal,13,2,8753716,298-311,0,DFG,390727645,Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,4,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8753716,,Excluido por nada que ver

NO,10.1016/j.sysarc.2021.102116,Learning based compilation of embedded applications targeting minimal energy consumption,"The choice of correct optimization passes during compilation is one of the major factors that determines the performance and energy consumption of an application when executed on a target hardware. However, making such a choice is challenging since it requires knowledge of target architecture, code features and compiler pass interdependence. Software developers mostly rely on heuristic approaches while choosing the optimization passes. However, such heuristic solutions and random choices often yield sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose an automated technique of determining the optimal compiler optimization setting for minimum energy consumption utilizing power profile results and performance characteristics from real hardware and machine learning models. The proposed approach on one hand brings about reduction in energy consumption and on the other releases embedded software developers from making the complicated compiler optimization choices for each application.

SI,10.1007/s10846-021-01400-7,A Methodological Approach to the Learning of Robotics with EDUROSC-Kids,"With advances in science and technology, several innovative researches have been developed trying to figure out the main problems related to children’s learning. It is known that issues such as frustration and inattention, between others, affect student learning. In this fashion, robotics is an important resource that can be used towards helping to solve these issues, empowering our students in order to push their learning up. In this case, robotic tools are generally used considering two different paradigms: as the main focus and as a secondary focus. Actually, these paradigms define the way that Educational Robotics is implemented in schools. Most of the approaches have implemented it as the main focus, which is teaching Robotics. Nevertheless, there are quite a few works that implement robotics as a secondary focus, which is currently assisting the learning process in several disciplines. The main contribution of this work is a complete three steps methodology for Robotics in Education to guide projects in order to either use it alone or to teach robotics with others topics. Our experiments show the importance of devising a study plan and evaluation method because the process is iterative and could improve the final results. As a novelty, here we have joined and extended our previous works by proposing a new set of methods with guidelines and strategies for applying the educational robotics standard curriculum for kids, named EDUROSC-Kids. We propose several tools that have been developed to organize the learning topics of Robotics for children, including the desired outcomes during the learning process. As said our current approach is divided in three steps (or phases): setting up the environment, defining the project, and performing evaluation. The proposed curriculum organizes robotics contents into five disciplines: Robotics and Society, Mechanics, Electronics, Programming, and Control Theory.

This paper proposes an AI-based system comprised of three modules that can capture the operator and environment status and process status, identify the tasks that are being executed by the operator using vision-based machine learning, and provide customized operator support from the robot side for shared tasks, automatically adapting to the operator’s needs and preferences. Moreover, the proposed system is able to assess the ergonomics in human–robot shared tasks and adapt the robot pose to improve ergonomics using a heuristics-based search algorithm.

NO,10.3901/JME.2021.11.128,Flexible Needle Path Planning Based on the Iterative Learning Algorithm,"Path planning plays an important role in robot-assisted flexible needle insertion procedures. The trajectory errors derived from the needle-tissue interaction can be predicted based on a proper needle-tissue interaction model, which is important for needle path planning, especially when the needle is inserted into highly deformable tissues. A novel iterative learning-based path planning method is proposed. First, a set of candidate paths are offline generated according to the reachable domain analysis under non-deformable environment, wherein the best candidate path is selected based on genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GSAA). Then, a real-time needle-tissue interaction model is utilized to predict the target deformation and needle deflection, which is combined with an iterative learning control-based path correction algorithm to achieve satisfactory trajectory accuracy. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis is applied to the proposed planning framework for parameter optimization. Needle insertion experiments are conducted with pre-defined targets and obstacles in phantoms to verify the proposed path planning methods. The results show that the error of the proposed algorithm can reach an average error below 0.45 mm.",ar,2021-06-05,Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering,Flexible needle | Iterative learning control | Minimally invasive needle insertion | Needle trajectory planning,2-s2.0-85112487785,,,Article,Li M.,60117982;60023133,State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic System;Qinghai University,Hangzhou;Xining,China;China,7,"Li, Murong;Lei, Yong;Huang, Cheng;Hu, Yingda;Du, Shilun;Guan, Haotian;Gao, Dedong",57204238341;55697966200;57201467051;57222337398;57226732788;57226730609;15762514100,60117982;60117982;60117982;60117982;60117982;60117982;60023133,5 June 2021,5776686,20948,,Journal,57,11,,128-137,0,,undefined,,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.3901/JME.2021.11.128,,Excluido por machine learning

Although some authors claim that robotics in classrooms may be a promising new tool to address the creativity crisis in school, we often face a lack of theoretical development of the concept of creativity and the mechanisms involved. In this article, we will first provide an overview of existing research using educational robotics to foster creativity. We show that in this line of work the exact mechanisms promoted by robotics activities are rarely discussed. We use a confluence model of creativity to account for the positive effect of designing and coding robots on students' creative output. We focus on the cognitive components of the process of constructing and programming robots within the context of existing models of creative cognition. We address as well the question of the role of meta-reasoning and emergent strategies in the creative process. Then, in the second part of the article, we discuss how the notion of creativity applies to robots themselves in terms of the creative processes that can be embodied in these artificial agents.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3070308,Volumetric occupancy mapping with probabilistic depth completion for robotic navigation,"In robotic applications, a key requirement for safe and efficient motion planning is the ability to map obstacle-free space in unknown, cluttered 3D environments. However, commodity-grade RGB-D cameras commonly used for sensing fail to register valid depth values on shiny, glossy, bright, or distant surfaces, leading to missing data in the map. To address this issue, we propose a framework leveraging probabilistic depth completion as an additional input for spatial mapping. We introduce a deep learning architecture providing uncertainty estimates for the depth completion of RGB-D images. Our pipeline exploits the inferred missing depth values and depth uncertainty to complement raw depth images and improve the speed and quality of free space mapping. Evaluations on synthetic data show that our approach maps significantly more correct free space with relatively low error when compared against using raw data alone in different indoor environments; thereby producing more complete maps that can be directly used for robotic navigation tasks.

NO,10.1007/s11280-020-00778-y,OpenCL-Darknet: implementation and optimization of OpenCL-based deep learning object detection framework,"Object detection is a technology that deals with recognizing classes of objects and their location. It is used in many different areas, such as in face-detecting systems [16, 34, 37], surveillance tools [9], human-machine interfaces [17], and self-driving cars [18, 23, 25, 26, 30]. These days, deep learning object detection approaches have achieved significantly better performance than the classical feature-based algorithms. Darknet [31] is a deep learning object detection framework, which is well known for its fast speed and simple structure. Unfortunately, Darknet can only work with Nvidia CUDA [6] for accelerating its deep learning calculations. For this reason, users have only limited options of selecting appropriate graphic cards. Open computing language (OpenCL) [35], an open standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of heterogeneous systems, is available for the general hardware accelerators. However, many deep learning frameworks including Darknet have no support for OpenCL. In our previous paper, we presented OpenCL-Darknet [19], which transformed the CUDA-based Darknet into an open standard OpenCL backend. The original OpenCL-Darknet successfully showed its ability for the general graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware. However, it could not achieve competitive performance compared with the CUDA version, and it only supported a limited platform. In this study, we improved the performance of OpenCL-Darknet with several optimization techniques and added support for various architectures. We also evaluated OpenCL-Darknet not only in AMD R7 accelerated processing unit (APU) with OpenCL 2.0, but also in Nvidia GPU and ARM Mali embedded GPU with OpenCL 1.2 Profile. The evaluation using the standard object detection datasets showed that our advanced OpenCL-Darknet reduced the processing time by at most 50% on average for various deep learning object detection networks compared with our original implementation. We also showed that our OpenCL deep learning framework has competitiveness compared with the CUDA-based one.",ar,2021-07-01,World Wide Web,deep learning | image processing | object detection | OpenCL | parallel programming,2-s2.0-85079457281,,,Article,Koo Y.,60001558;60000142,Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute;Konkuk University,Daejeon;Seoul,South Korea;South Korea,3,"Koo, Yongbon;Kim, Sunghoon;Ha, Young guk",14056154100;35731778100;23389377100,60001558;60001558;60000142,July 2021,1386145X,14965,15731413,Journal,24,4,,1299-1319,0,MOTIE,undefined,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy",4,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11280-020-00778-y,,Excluido por machine learning

This letter investigates safe navigation in unknown environments, using on-board range sensing to construct control barrier functions online. To represent different objects in the environment, we use the distance measurements to train neural network approximations of the signed distance functions incrementally with replay memory.

However, the existing task planning approaches for HRC are still limited in many ways, e.g., co-robot encoding must rely on experts’ knowledge and the real-time task scheduling is applicable within small state-action spaces or simplified problem settings. In this paper, the HRC assembly working process is formatted into a novel chessboard setting, in which the selection of chess piece move is used to analogize to the decision making by both humans and robots in the HRC assembly working process. To optimize the completion time, a Markov game model is considered, which takes the task structure and the agent status as the state input and the overall completion time as the reward. Without experts’ knowledge, this game model is capable of seeking for correlated equilibrium policy among agents with convergency in making real-time decisions facing a dynamic environment. To improve the efficiency in finding an optimal policy of the task scheduling, a deep-Q-network (DQN) based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is applied and compared with the Nash-Q learning, dynamic programming and the DQN-based single-agent reinforcement learning method.

The method utilizes 3D Voronoi diagrams and Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate an optimal path that balances cost between the size and shape change of the robot and the length of the path. The Voronoi method is particularly suitable for circumferentially expanding robots because the waypoints generated lay where a device with a circular cross-section would naturally sit.

NO,10.1109/TASE.2020.2996018,Optimal Feedback Control of Pedestrian Flow in Heterogeneous Corridors,"Maintaining the orderliness and efficiency of pedestrian flow through an architectural area is critical for the evacuation process. Especially, clogs and jams are easily triggered in width-changing areas. In this article, we consider pedestrian movement in heterogeneous corridors and design an optimal feedback control to regulate pedestrian flow. Flow characteristics are first studied based on microscopic social-force simulations. A Gaussian process describes the relationship between flow variables with the observation data. The macroscopic model for flow in heterogeneous corridors is developed. To avoid jams, discharges among these corridors are balanced with the narrowest corridor as the primary concern. At the equilibrium, a continuous-time nonlinear control system is formulated, and the adaptive dynamic programming learns the optimal feedback controller. Policy iteration (PI) and neural networks are combined together, and the convergence of neural-network-based PI is demonstrated by analyzing its equivalence to the Gauss-Newton method. Batch normalization is introduced to stabilize the learning process. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the control design can effectively regulate pedestrian flow for both macroscopic and microscopic models. Note to Practitioners - The development of video-processing techniques provides a powerful tool to detect human behavior in real time. In crowd events, the pedestrian movement must be regulated; otherwise, it is easy to fall into the faster-is-slower effect. It is especially important for evacuation routes with different widths. In this article, the optimal feedback control is studied to regulate pedestrian flow in heterogeneous corridors. It takes flow densities as state and produces commands that are composed of entrance influx and free-flow velocities. These commands can be executed with the support of speakers, displays, or the recently developed interactive robots. To avoid congestion, discharges of different corridors are balanced, and the system is optimally stabilized at equilibrium.

NO,10.3390/electronics10131562,Design of a laboratory scale solar microgrid cyber-physical system for education,"Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide an effective solution for reducing dependency on conventional power generation and increasing the reliability and quality of power systems. Presented in this paper are design and implementation of a laboratory scale solar microgrid cyber-physical system (CPS) with wireless data monitoring as a teaching tool in the engineering technology curriculum. In the system, the solar panel, battery, charge controller, and loads form the physical layer, while the sensors, communication networks, supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) and control systems form the cyber layer. The physical layer was seamlessly integrated with the cyber layer consisting of control and communication. The objective was to create a robust CPS platform and to use the system to promote interest in and knowledge of renewable energy among university students. Experimental results showed that the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) charge controller provided the loads with power from the solar panel and used additional power to charge the rechargeable battery.

NO,10.1109/JSEN.2020.3038143,Hybrid Embedded-Systems-Based Approach to in-Driver Drunk Status Detection Using Image Processing and Sensor Networks,"Car drivers under the influence of alcohol is one of the most common causes of road traffic accidents. To tackle this issue, an emerging, suitable alternative is the use of intelligent systems -traditionally based on either sensor networks or artificial vision- that are aimed to prevent starting the car when drunk status on the car driver is detected. In such vein, this paper introduces a system whose main objective is identifying a person having alcohol in the blood through supervised classification of sensor-generated and computer-vision-based data. To do so, some drunk-status criteria are considered, namely: the concentration of alcohol in the car environment, the facial temperature of the driver and the pupil width. Specifically, for data acquisition purposes, the proposed system incorporates a gas sensor, temperature sensor and a digital camera. Acquired data are analyzed into a two-stages machine learning system consisting of feature selection and supervised classification algorithms. Both acquisition and analysis stages are to be performed into a embedded system, and therefore all procedures and algorithms are designed to work at low-computational resources. As a remarkable outcome, due mainly to the incorporation of feature selection and relevance analysis stages, proposed approach reaches a classification performance of 98% while ensures adequate operation conditions for the embedded system.",ar,2021-07-15,IEEE Sensors Journal,Classification algorithms | computer vision | drunk detection | intelligent system | sensors,2-s2.0-85098779684,,,Article,Rosero-Montalvo P.D.,60192082;60107287;60105012;60025028;126606402,Mohammed VI Polytechnic University;Universidad Técnica del Norte;Yachay Tech;Universidad de Salamanca;Corporación Universitaria Autónoma de Nariño,Ben Guerir;Ibarra;Urcuqui;Salamanca;Pasto,Morocco;Ecuador;Ecuador;Spain;Colombia,3,"Rosero-Montalvo, Paul D.;Lopez-Batista, Vivian Felix;Peluffo-Ordonez, Diego Hernan",57192274114;56230743600;35746975300,60025028-60107287;60025028;60105012-60192082-126606402,15 July 2021,1530437X,15047,15581748,Journal,21,14,9258992,15729-15740,0,,undefined,,1,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9258992,,Excluido por machine learning

The robot instructs the participants, demonstrates the exercises and provides real-time corrective and positive feedback according to the participant’s performance as monitored by an RGB-D camera. Two robotic systems based on two different humanoid robots (Nao, toy-like and Poppy, mechanical-like) were developed and implemented using the Python programming language. Experimental studies with 32 older adults were conducted, to determine the preferable mode and timing of the feedback provided to the user to accommodate user preferences, motivate the users and improve their interaction with the system. Additionally, user preferences with regards to the two different humanoid robots used were explored. The results revealed that the system motivated the older adults to engage more in physical exercises. The type and timing of feedback influenced this engagement. Most of these older adults also perceived the system as very useful, easy to use, had a positive attitude towards the system and noted their intention to use it.

However, the uncertainties brought by the human partner challenge the task-planning and decision-making of the robot. When aiming at industrial tasks like collaborative assembly, dynamics on temporal dimension and stochasticities on the order of procedures need to be further considered. In this work, we bring a new perspective and solution based on reinforcement learning, where the problem is regarded as training an agent towards tasks in dynamic and stochastic environments. Concretely, an adapted training approach based on the deep Q learning method is proposed. This method regards both the robot and the human as the agents in the interactive training environment for deep reinforcement learning. With the consideration of task-level industrial human-robot collaboration, the training logic and the agent-environment interaction have been proposed.

NO,10.1016/j.aei.2021.101360,Deep reinforcement learning-based safe interaction for industrial human-robot collaboration using intrinsic reward function,"Aiming at human-robot collaboration in manufacturing, the operator's safety is the primary issue during the manufacturing operations. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach to realize the real-time collision-free motion planning of an industrial robot for human-robot collaboration. Firstly, the safe human-robot collaboration manufacturing problem is formulated into a Markov decision process, and the mathematical expression of the reward function design problem is given. The goal is that the robot can autonomously learn a policy to reduce the accumulated risk and assure the task completion time during human-robot collaboration. To transform our optimization object into a reward function to guide the robot to learn the expected behaviour, a reward function optimizing approach based on the deterministic policy gradient is proposed to learn a parameterized intrinsic reward function. The reward function for the agent to learn the policy is the sum of the intrinsic reward function and the extrinsic reward function. Then, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm intrinsic reward-deep deterministic policy gradient (IRDDPG), which is the combination of the DDPG algorithm and the reward function optimizing approach, is proposed to learn the expected collision avoidance policy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested in a simulation environment, and the results show that the industrial robot can learn the expected policy to achieve the safety assurance for industrial human-robot collaboration without missing the original target. Moreover, the reward function optimizing approach can help make up for the designed reward function and improve policy performance.",ar,2021-08-01,Advanced Engineering Informatics,Collision avoidance | Deep reinforcement learning | Industrial human-robot collaboration | Intrinsic reward function,2-s2.0-85110771944,S1474034621001130,,Article,Liu Q.,60022414;60009358;60007154;60002014,Wuhan University of Technology;Linköpings Universitet;Vaasan Yliopisto;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Wuhan;Linkoping;Vaasa;Stockholm,China;Sweden;Finland;Sweden,5,"Liu, Quan;Liu, Zhihao;Xiong, Bo;Xu, Wenjun;Liu, Yang",55577742400;57202399533;57214913333;57221159460;55812026500,60022414;60022414-60002014;60022414;60022414;60009358-60007154,August 2021,14740346,23640,,Journal,49,,101360,,0,IDA,20GJHZ0039,Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore,1,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474034621001130?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por machine learning

The control of an actual system with LabVIEW and NI hardware provides an efficient implementation platform, using both LabVIEW’s graphical programming and the text-based m-file language MathScript RT. Both programming environments and the connection to NI hardware are relatively easy to use, therefore, ideal for education. The graphical “coding” can help novice users to see through their algorithms. However, the mathematical background of sliding mode control is difficult compared to conventional PID control; the SMC implementation for practical uses can be quite simple, as the presented example demonstrates. The first didactic step is a simulation with the Control Design and Simulation, as well as MathScript RT Modules. Then a myRIO Student Embedded Device is used to control a real servo system.

The “Coding as Another Language” (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated “unplugged” CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (Mchange = 0.94, p < .001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (Mchange = 0.27, p = .07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p < .01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CAL-KIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation. Young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum.

PowerShell is a programming language based on the command line and.NET framework, with powerful functions and good compatibility. Therefore, hackers often use PowerShell malicious scripts to attack the victims in APT attacks. When these malicious PowerShell scripts are executed, hackers can control the victim's computer or leave a backdoor on their computers. In this paper, a detection model of malicious PowerShell scripts based on hybrid features is proposed, we analyzed the differences between malicious and benign samples in text characters, functions, tokens and the nodes of the abstract syntax tree. Firstly, the script of PowerShell is embedded by FastText. Then the textual features, token features and the nodes features of PowerShell code extracted from the abstract syntax tree are added. Finally, the hybrid features of scrips will be classified by a Random Forest classifier. In the experiment, the malicious scripts are inserted into the benign scripts to weaken the features of the malicious samples in the level of abstract syntax tree nodes and tokens, which makes the scripts more complex. Even in such a complex data set, the proposed model which is based on hybrid features still achieves an accuracy of 97.76% in fivefold cross-validation. Moreover, the accuracy of this proposed model on the original scripts is 98.93%, which means that the proposed model has the ability to classify complex scripts.",ar,2021-08-11,Neurocomputing,Abstract syntax tree | Machine learning | Powershell | Scripts detection,2-s2.0-85104338782,S0925231221005099,,Article,Fang Y.,60016521,Sichuan University,Chengdu,China,3,"Fang, Yong;Zhou, Xiangyu;Huang, Cheng",57026722800;57226235512;55511401300,60016521;60016521;60016521,11 August 2021,9252312,24807,18728286,Journal,448,,,30-39,0,NSFC,GCIS201921,Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program,0,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231221005099?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por nada que ver (security)

This paper introduces a fast and robust collision-free path-planning method based on deep reinforcement learning. A recurrent neural network is first adopted to remember and exploit the past states observed by the robot, then a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) predicts a collision-free path from the states. A simulation environment is developed and its parameters are randomized during the training phase to enable recurrent DDPG to generalize to real-world scenarios. We also introduce an image processing method that uses a deep neural network to detect obstacles and uses many three-dimensional line segments to approximate the obstacles. Simulations show that recurrent DDPG only needs 29 ms to plan a collision-free path with a success rate of 90.90%. Field tests show that recurrent DDPG can increase grasp, detachment, and harvest success rates by 19.43%, 9.11%, and 10.97%, respectively, compared to cases where no collision-free path-planning algorithm is implemented.

Each limb is composed of several basic module units with identical structure and function, which makes it modularized and reconfigurable. The robotic limbs can work as extra arms of the astronaut to assist them outside the space station cabin. In this paper, the robotic limbs are designed and developed. The reinforcement learning method is introduced to achieve autonomous motion planning capacity for the robot, which makes the robot intelligent enough to assist the astronaut in unstructured environment.

NO,10.1177/0278364920940781,Fast deep swept volume estimator,"Despite decades of research on efficient swept volume computation for robotics, computing the exact swept volume is intractable and approximate swept volume algorithms have been computationally prohibitive for applications such as motion and task planning. In this work, we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) for fast swept volume estimation. Since swept volume is a property of robot kinematics, a DNN can be trained off-line once in a supervised manner and deployed in any environment. The trained DNN is fast during on-line swept volume geometry or size inferences. Results show that DNNs can accurately and rapidly estimate swept volumes caused by rotational, translational, and prismatic joint motions. Sampling-based planners using the learned distance are up to five times more efficient and identify paths with smaller swept volumes on simulated and physical robots. Results also show that swept volume geometry estimation with a DNN is over 98.9% accurate and 1,200 times faster than an octree-based swept volume algorithm.",ar,2021-09-01,International Journal of Robotics Research,deep learning | motion planning | Swept volume,2-s2.0-85089006767,,,Article,Chiang H.T.L.,60033021;60006191,The University of New Mexico;Google LLC,Albuquerque;Mountain View,United States;United States,6,"Chiang, Hao Tien Lewis;Baxter, John E.G.;Sugaya, Satomi;Yousefi, Mohammad R.;Faust, Aleksandra;Tapia, Lydia",56742715400;56438810800;56425735300;57218366840;55922020500;14034628800,60033021-60006191;60033021;60033021;60033021;60006191;60033021,September 2021,2783649,18050,17413176,Journal,40,10-11,,1068-1086,1,NSF,IIS-1528047,National Science Foundation,0,2021,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364920940781,,Excluido por no educación
NO,10.1002/cae.22353,Teaching concepts related to finite automata using ComVis,"This paper describes educational software for visualization and finite automata simulation. The system was developed in Java programming language, and its main purpose is learning process improvement. Using this software, finite automata can be defined in a graphical editor in the form of a state diagram, or by defining the transition function using the transition table. Upon defining an automaton, it is possible to run a visual simulation of the automaton operation for an arbitrary input string, whereby a textual description of the automaton simulation is also obtained. Furthermore, the system allows for conversion of regular expressions to deterministic finite automata and nondeterministic finite automata. The simulation of Thompson's construction algorithm is implemented, so that transformation of a regular expression to the corresponding NFA can be monitored in a step-by-step process. The quantitative analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the simulator are based on a survey of undergraduate students at two universities.

Although these tools provide highly accurate solutions, they may not be suitable for large scale problems and for optimization applications. Looking for alternatives to complex formulations that often lead to convergence issues and to time consuming solutions, the use of surrogate modeling for reaction systems is addressed herein. We propose a novel adaptive sampling algorithm that iteratively explores the solution space and incorporates ideas from adaptive sampling, trust region methods, and successive linear programming approaches. The surrogates are iteratively embedded into optimization problems to check feasibility and to collect insights to the following adaptive sampling iteration. The methodology is applied to a reaction system network and the surrogates are built to predict the reactor outputs. The adaptive sampling algorithm builds highly accurate surrogates that can be embedded into the reaction system optimization leading to near optimal solutions.",ar,2021-09-01,Computers and Chemical Engineering,Adaptive sampling algorithm | Data-driven | Machine learning | Reactor systems | Surrogate modeling,2-s2.0-85108091980,S0098135421001496,,Article,Franzoi R.E.,60113885;60106385;60008088;113231158,"Hamad Bin Khalifa University, College of Science and Engineering;McMaster University, Faculty of Engineering;Universidade de São Paulo;Industrial Algorithms",Doha;Hamilton;Sao Paulo;Toronto,Qatar;Canada;Brazil;Canada,4,"Franzoi, Robert E.;Kelly, Jeffrey D.;Menezes, Brenno C.;Swartz, Christopher L.E.",57203130478;7404901361;55980129100;7102202663,60008088;113231158;60113885;60106385,September 2021,981354,24600,,Journal,152,,107371,,0,FAPESP,2017/03310-1,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,2,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0098135421001496?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación (optimization)
NO,10.1016/j.engappai.2021.104382,Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with state variable constraints for mobile robot navigation,"Autonomous mobile robots employed in industrial applications often operate in complex and uncertain environments. In this paper we propose an approach based on an extension of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) for robot velocity regulation in industrial-like environments characterized by uncertain motion difficulties. The velocity selected by POMCP is used by a standard engine controller which deals with path planning. This two-layer approach allows POMCP to exploit prior knowledge on the relationships between task similarities to improve performance in terms of time spent to traverse a path with obstacles. We also propose three measures to support human-understanding of the strategy used by POMCP to improve the performance. The overall architecture is tested on a Turtlebot3 in two environments, a rectangular path and a realistic production line in a research lab. Tests performed on a C++ simulator confirm the capability of the proposed approach to profitably use prior knowledge, achieving a performance improvement from 0.7% to 3.1% depending on the complexity of the path. Experiments on a Unity simulator show that the proposed two-layer approach outperforms also single-layer approaches based only on the engine controller (i.e., without the POMCP layer). In this case the performance improvement is up to 37% comparing to a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning engine controller, and up to 51% comparing to the standard ROS engine controller. Finally, experiments in a real-world testing arena confirm the possibility to run the approach on real robots.",ar,2021-09-01,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,Explainable planning | Industry 4.0 | Mobile robot planning | Planning under uncertainty | POMCP | POMDP,2-s2.0-85111045874,S095219762100230X,,Article,Castellini A.,60032256,Università degli Studi di Verona,Verona,Italy,3,"Castellini, Alberto;Marchesini, Enrico;Farinelli, Alessandro",23476375900;57216753456;8856607700,60032256;60032256;60032256,September 2021,9521976,24182,,Journal,104,,104382,,0,H2020,689341,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,1,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095219762100230X?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación (robot navigation)

Education around these tools is often set in group contexts and collaboration is typically considered an important part of the learning process. However, much of the software tools currently available are still designed around a laptop programming paradigm that tends to restrict collaboration rather than encourage shifting of roles and sharing of experiences.

NO,10.1007/s10846-021-01458-3,The State of Lifelong Learning in Service Robots:: Current Bottlenecks in Object Perception and Manipulation,"Service robots are appearing more and more in our daily life. The development of service robots combines multiple fields of research, from object perception to object manipulation. The state-of-the-art continues to improve to make a proper coupling between object perception and manipulation. This coupling is necessary for service robots not only to perform various tasks in a reasonable amount of time but also to continually adapt to new environments and safely interact with non-expert human users. Nowadays, robots are able to recognize various objects, and quickly plan a collision-free trajectory to grasp a target object in predefined settings. Besides, in most of the cases, there is a reliance on large amounts of training data. Therefore, the knowledge of such robots is fixed after the training phase, and any changes in the environment require complicated, time-consuming, and expensive robot re-programming by human experts. Therefore, these approaches are still too rigid for real-life applications in unstructured environments, where a significant portion of the environment is unknown and cannot be directly sensed or controlled. In such environments, no matter how extensive the training data used for batch learning, a robot will always face new objects. Therefore, apart from batch learning, the robot should be able to continually learn about new object categories and grasp affordances from very few training examples on-site. Moreover, apart from robot self-learning, non-expert users could interactively guide the process of experience acquisition by teaching new concepts, or by correcting insufficient or erroneous concepts. In this way, the robot will constantly learn how to help humans in everyday tasks by gaining more and more experiences without the need for re-programming. In this paper, we review a set of previously published works and discuss advances in service robots from object perception to complex object manipulation and shed light on the current challenges and bottlenecks.",ar,2021-09-01,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,Cognitive robotics | Lifelong learning | Object manipulation | Object perception | Open-ended learning | Service robots,2-s2.0-85112016866,,,Article,Kasaei S.H.,60010023,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,Groningen,Netherlands,5,"Kasaei, S.

Taking into account the globalization of information and the worldwide reproduction of databases, facilitating access to CAD files to be reproduced in 3D printing promotes the easy construction of archived mechanical designs. A robotic architecture becomes a complex assembly by having multiple operating systems. The sensorics, mechanics, electronics and programming that it requires for navigation, collaboration, development, operation and even industrial manufacturing means that more and more elaborate embedded systems are used. In this work, a mobile robotics architecture was developed with a sensory system that allows free movement and navigation in closed loop inverse kinematics.

Motion planning is a fundamental topic in robotics that has received wide attention due to its importance in the development of industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing systems. This study sought to develop a deep learning-based optimization algorithm for planning collision-free trajectories of dual-arm assembly robots in complex operational environments. Given the high dimensionality of the robotic motion patterns, a Bi-directional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree integrated with the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM-BiRRT) method is proposed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the planning process. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the LSTM-BiRRT algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches developed for motion planning of dual-arm robots in both two- and three-dimensional environments.

Gaussian Mixture Model and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMM and GMR) are useful tools for implementing such a LfD approach. However, well-performed GMM/GMR require a series of demonstrations without trembling and jerky features, which are challenging to achieve in actual environments. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel optimised approach to improve Gaussian clusters then further GMM/GMR so that LfD enabled cobots can carry out a variety of complex manufacturing tasks effectively. This research has three distinguishing innovative characteristics: 1) a Gaussian noise strategy is designed to scatter demonstrations with trembling and jerky features to better support the optimisation of GMM/GMR; 2) a Simulated Annealing-Reinforcement Learning (SA-RL) based optimisation algorithm is developed to refine the number of Gaussian clusters in eliminating potential under-/over-fitting issues on GMM/GMR; 3) a B-spline based cut-in algorithm is integrated with GMR to improve the adaptability of reproduced solutions for dynamic manufacturing tasks.

In one method, students create programs from scratch; in the other, they start with a faulty program they have to fix. These teaching methods were evaluated using the framework of learning ecology, which provides a holistic framework for assessing complex learning environments. We identified different indicators of learning ecology and assessed our workshops using a mixed-methods approach. Our results showed no difference between the groups on the intrinsic dimension of a learning ecology. However, on the experiential dimension, the learners in the create group scored better on all tests.

Our algorithm adapts the centralized, perfect information, discrete-action space method from AlphaZero to a decentralized, partial information, continuous action space setting for multi-robot applications. Our method has three interacting components: (i) a centralized, perfect-information 'expert' Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with large computation resources that provides expert demonstrations, (ii) a decentralized, partial-information 'learner' MCTS with small computation resources that runs in real-time and provides self-play examples, and (iii) policy & value neural networks that are trained with the expert demonstrations and bias both the expert and the learner tree growth. Our numerical experiments demonstrate Neural Tree Expansion's computational advantage by finding better solutions than a MCTS with 20 times more resources. The resulting policies are dynamically sophisticated, demonstrate coordination between robots, and play the Reach-Target-Avoid differential game significantly better than the state-of-the-art control-theoretic baseline for multi-robot, double-integrator systems.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3103054,SABER: Data-driven motion planner for autonomously navigating heterogeneous robots,"We present an end-to-end online motion planning framework that uses a data-driven approach to navigate a heterogeneous robot team towards a global goal while avoiding obstacles in uncertain environments. First, we use stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) to calculate control inputs that satisfy robot dynamics, and consider uncertainty during obstacle avoidance with chance constraints. Second, recurrent neural networks are used to provide a quick estimate of future state uncertainty considered in the SMPC finite-time horizon solution, which are trained on uncertainty outputs of various simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms.

Lastly, a Deep Q-learning agent is employed to serve as a high-level path planner, providing the SMPC with target positions that move the robots towards a desired global goal.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3092685,Learning Kinematic Feasibility for Mobile Manipulation through Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Mobile manipulation tasks remain one of the critical challenges for the widespread adoption of autonomous robots in both service and industrial scenarios. While planning approaches are good at generating feasible whole-body robot trajectories, they struggle with dynamic environments as well as the incorporation of constraints given by the task and the environment. On the other hand, dynamic motion models in the action space struggle with generating kinematically feasible trajectories for mobile manipulation actions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn feasible dynamic motions for a mobile base while the end-effector follows a trajectory in task space generated by an arbitrary system to fulfill the task at hand. This modular formulation has several benefits: it enables us to readily transform a broad range of end-effector motions into mobile applications, it allows us to use the kinematic feasibility of the end-effector trajectory as a dense reward signal and its modular formulation allows it to generalise to unseen end-effector motions at test time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on multiple mobile robot platforms with different kinematic abilities and different types of wheeled platforms in extensive simulated as well as real-world experiments.",ar,2021-10-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Mobile manipulation | reinforcement learning,2-s2.0-85111156408,,,Article,Honerkamp D.,60025641,Universität Freiburg,Freiburg im Breisgau,Germany,3,"Honerkamp, Daniel;Welschehold, Tim;Valada, Abhinav",57222037397;56974419500;37121030000,60025641;60025641;60025641,October 2021,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,6,4,9465645,6289-6296,0,H2020,871449-OpenDR,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,0,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9465645,,Excluido por machine learning
NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2021.102167,Augmented reality-based robot teleoperation system using RGB-D imaging and attitude teaching device,"Augmented reality (AR)-based programming using the demonstration method has been widely studied. However, studies on AR-based programming for remote robots are lacking because of the limitation of human–computer interaction. This paper proposes an AR-based robot teleoperation system and method using RGB-D imaging and an attitude teaching device. By sending the color and depth images of the remote robot environment to the local side, the operators can complete the teleoperation of the robot at the local side. First, the operators select key positions on the motion path of the robot endpoint from color images via a mouse, and the computer calculates the 3D coordinates of these key points in the robot base coordinate system to complete the position teaching process. In the robot attitude teaching process, the AR technology is used to superimpose the virtual robot model onto the color images of the robot teleoperation environment, so as to make the virtual robot endpoint to move along the teaching path. An operator can use the portable attitude teaching device designed in this study to control the robot movement parameters, such as the attitude and motion speed, during the movement of the virtual robot. After the position and attitude teaching processes, the robot movement trajectory can be generated. To make the base coordinate system of the virtual model consistent with that of the physical robot, we propose an online AR registration method, which does not require manually placing the AR registration marker. The proposed AR-based robot teleoperation system can quickly and easily complete robot teleoperation at the local side.",ar,2021-10-01,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,AR registration | Augmented reality | Online teaching programming | RGB-D imaging | Robot teleoperation,2-s2.0-85103686253,S073658452100051X,,Article,Pan Y.,60030434;60018308,Qingdao University;Xi'an Jiaotong University,Qingdao;Xi'an,China;China,5,"Pan, Yong;Chen, Chengjun;Li, Dongnian;Zhao, Zhengxu;Hong, Jun",57214079983;8947161500;56419003000;7404147555;7404118243,60030434;60030434;60030434;60030434;60018308,October 2021,7365845,18080,,Journal,71,,102167,,0,NSFC,2019KJB020,National Natural Science Foundation of China,1,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073658452100051X?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no programación
NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2021.102130,A visual path-following learning approach for industrial robots using DRL,"Manufacturing companies are in constant need for improved agility. An adequate combination of speed, responsiveness, and business agility to cope with fluctuating raw material costs is essential for today's increasingly demanding markets. Agility in robots is key in operations requiring on-demand control of a robot's tool position and orientation, reducing or eliminating extra programming efforts. Vision-based perception using full-state or partial-state observations and learning techniques are useful to create truly adaptive industrial robots. We propose using a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to solve path-following tasks using a simplified virtual environment with domain randomisation to provide the agent with enough exploration and observation variability during the training to generate useful policies to be transferred to an industrial robot. We validated our approach using a KUKA KR16HW robot equipped with a Fronius GMAW welding machine. The path was manually drawn on two workpieces so the robot was able to perceive, learn and follow it during welding experiments. It was also found that small processing times due to motion prediction (3.5 ms) did not slow down the process, which resulted in smooth robot operations.

This study explores the relationship between the programming learning environment (including VPE, physical robots, and no experience) and the computational thinking ability of higher-grade elementary school students of different genders. The results show that learning through VPE or physical robots can help students improve their computational thinking ability and that students learn better via physical robots. In addition, among the four dimensions of computational thinking ability, most students are weak in algorithm design. In terms of gender, no differences exist in computational thinking ability.

NO,10.1007/s10846-021-01477-0,Distributed Planning for Serving Cooperative Tasks with Time Windows: A Game Theoretic Approach,"We study distributed planning for multi-robot systems to provide optimal service to cooperative tasks that are distributed over space and time. Each task requires service by sufficiently many robots at the specified location within the specified time window. Tasks arrive over episodes and the robots try to maximize the total value of service in each episode by planning their own trajectories based on the specifications of incoming tasks. Robots are required to start and end each episode at their assigned stations in the environment. We present a game theoretic solution to this problem by mapping it to a game, where the action of each robot is its trajectory in an episode, and using a suitable learning algorithm to obtain optimal joint plans in a distributed manner. We present a systematic way to design minimal action sets (subsets of feasible trajectories) for robots based on the specifications of incoming tasks to facilitate fast learning. We then provide the performance guarantees for the cases where all the robots follow a best response or noisy best response algorithm to iteratively plan their trajectories. While the best response algorithm leads to a Nash equilibrium, the noisy best response algorithm leads to globally optimal joint plans with high probability. We show that the proposed game can in general have arbitrarily poor Nash equilibria, which makes the noisy best response algorithm preferable unless the task specifications are known to have some special structure. We also describe a family of special cases where all the equilibria are guaranteed to have bounded suboptimality.

NO,10.1016/j.compeleceng.2021.107412,Fast path planning for underwater robots by combining goal-biased Gaussian sampling with focused optimal search,"Autonomous path planning plays an important role in the navigation of intelligent underwater robots. Path planning is a nondeterministic polynomial hard issue in classical path planning models. This problem can be solved using various sample-based strategies. However, the effectiveness of these sample-based strategies is significantly lower in underwater environments, owing to the special undulating terrain and obstacles that are sparser compared to those in the ground. In this study, a more efficient underwater path planning method is proposed for underwater robot navigation. The method employs a goal-biased Gaussian sampling algorithm to select searching nodes optimally, and a focused optimal search algorithm is proposed to accelerate the path optimization process. Combining these two algorithms results in high-efficiency and fast autonomous underwater path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate a shorter path and is more efficient than a rapidly exploring random tree star in underwater robot navigation.",ar,2021-10-01,Computers and Electrical Engineering,Autonomous path planning | Focused optimal searching | Goal-biased Gaussian distribution sampling | Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star | Robots navigation,2-s2.0-85114776777,S0045790621003773,,Article,Shen J.,60010851;111375131,Hohai University;Chang Jiang Water Resources Protection Institute,Nanjing;Wuhan,China;China,4,"Shen, Jie;Fu, Xiao;Wang, Huibin;Shen, Shaohong",55649252800;57211231032;24448829900;57256494100,60010851;60010851;60010851;111375131,October 2021,457906,18159,,Journal,95,,107412,,0,NNSFC,2017YFC0405801-03,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045790621003773?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por no educación

In traditional multirobot coordination algorithms, most of the solutions are in known environments, the target position that each robot needs to move to and the robot priority are set, which limits the autonomy of the robot. Only using visual information to solve the problem of multirobot coordination is still less. This paper proposes a multi-robot cooperative algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to make the robot more autonomous in the process of selecting target positions and moving. We use the end-to-end approach, using only the top view, that is, a robot-centered top view, and the first-person view, that is, the image information collected from the first-person perspective of the robot, as input. The proposed algorithm, which includes a dueling neural network structure, can solve task allocation and path planning; we call the algorithm TFDueling. Through its perception and understanding of the environment, the robot can reach the target position without collision, and the robot can move to any target position. We compare the proposed algorithm, TFDueling, with different input structure algorithms, TDueling and FDueling, and with different neural network structures, TFDQN and TFDDQN.

Moreover, a path planner was integrated with the reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance to solve the problem of not finding a path in a specific situation, thereby imposing path efficiency. The robots were trained about the policy of obstacle avoidance in environments where dynamic characteristics were considered with soft actor critic algorithm.

On the other hand, robots are adept at performing numerical computation and repetitive physical tasks with precise motion control. The unstructured and complex nature of construction environments and the inability to maintain tight tolerances in assembled workpieces pose several unique challenges to the wide application of robots in construction work. Thus, the robotization of field construction processes is best conceived as a collaborative human-robot endeavor that takes advantage of both human and robot intelligence as well as robots' physical operation capabilities to overcome uncertainties and successfully perform useful construction work onsite. This paper proposes an interactive and immersive process-level digital twin (I2PL-DT) system in virtual reality (VR) that integrates visualization and supervision, task planning and execution, and bidirectional communication to enable collaborative human-robot construction work. In this work paradigm, the human worker is responsible for high-level task planning and work process supervision.

A BN is composed of a network structure and a conditional probability distribution table for each node. Discovering an optimal BN structure is an NP-hard optimization problem that various meta-heuristic algorithms are applied to solve this problem by researchers. The genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, evolutionary programming, artificial bee colony, and bacterial foraging optimization are some of the meta-heuristic methods to solve this problem using a dataset. Most of these methods are applying a scoring metric to generate the best network structure from a set of candidates. A Fixed Structure Learning Automata-Based (FSLA-B) algorithm is presented in this paper to solve the structure learning problem of BNs. There is a fixed structure learning automaton for each pair of vertices in the BN's graph structure in the proposed algorithm. The action of this automaton determines the presence and direction of an edge between the vertices. The proposed algorithm performs a guided search procedure using the FSLA and escapes from local optimums. Several datasets are utilised in this paper to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

NO,10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108136,Human trajectory prediction and generation using LSTM models and GANs,"Human trajectory prediction is an important topic in several application domains, ranging from self-driving cars to environment design and planning, from socially-aware robots to intelligent tracking systems. This complex subject comes with different challenges, such as human-space interaction, human-human interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. Currently, these challenges, especially generalizability, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. This work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new methods and metrics to help understand trajectories. In particular, new deep learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures are used in both unimodal and multimodal contexts. These approaches are evaluated with new error metrics, which normalize some biases in standard metrics.

SI,10.3390/electronics10243056,Hydra: Introducing a low-cost framework for stem education using open tools,"STEM education is of paramount importance, especially in the lower levels of education, and it has been proven beneficial for students in many ways. Although there are various tools available, there are significant drawbacks mainly related to the cost and the ease of use. In this study, we introduce a new low-cost educational framework oriented toward elementary and secondary educational needs. The proposed system exploits open tools and low-cost devices. The system’s core is based on the popular Arduino microcontroller, a low-cost device supported by a large community. The overall system was designed and developed, providing an expandable, modular system of low complexity suitable for students with no or low prior knowledge in related subjects, among others, to programming, embedded devices, sensors and actuators, as well as robotics. Our scope was to provide a system with a small learning curve. Practically, this makes it possible in a short amount of time for the students to perform appealing yet straightforward tasks which will boost their selfconfidence and creativity, improve their technical skills and simultaneously provide a system with several capabilities usable in different kinds of projects.

In recent years, various studies have been conducted for path planning of unmanned surface vehicle (USV), especially to maritime transportation. Most of the traditional approaches include optimization algorithms for finding the shortest or fastest path. However, USV motion in complex environments demand multi-objective optimization and multi-modality constraints to cope with dynamic environments and moving obstacles. To this end, an improved Ant Colony Optimization with Fuzzy Logic (ACO-FL) is proposed to deal with local path planning for obstacle avoidance by taking into account wind, current, wave and dynamic obstacles. The proposed algorithm was compared to original ACO and popular Bug algorithm in simulation tests. The results showed that ACO-FL reached better performance compared to the other algorithms under examination in terms of optimal solution and convergence speed. Thus, the proposed algorithm can be considered as an effective approach for path planning of USVs.",ar,2021-12-01,Ocean Engineering,Ant colony optimization | Fuzzy logic | Local path planning | Maritime transportation | Unmanned surface vehicle,2-s2.0-85117728046,S0029801821012385,,Article,Lyridis D.V.,60002947,National Technical University of Athens,Athens,Greece,1,"Lyridis, Dimitrios V.",6506983549,60002947,1 December 2021,298018,28339,,Journal,241,,109890,,0,ERDF,Τ1ΕΔΚ-01907,European Regional Development Fund,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2021.109890,,Excluido por no robótica educativa

This article describes an instructional method to perform Newtonian physics experiments by programming a mobile robot.

NO,10.1177/02783649211056967,Learning to solve sequential physical reasoning problems from a scene image,"In this article, we propose deep visual reasoning, which is a convolutional recurrent neural network that predicts discrete action sequences from an initial scene image for sequential manipulation problems that arise, for example, in task and motion planning (TAMP). Typical TAMP problems are formalized by combining reasoning on a symbolic, discrete level (e.g., first-order logic) with continuous motion planning such as nonlinear trajectory optimization. The action sequences represent the discrete decisions on a symbolic level, which, in turn, parameterize a nonlinear trajectory optimization problem. Owing to the great combinatorial complexity of possible discrete action sequences, a large number of optimization/motion planning problems have to be solved to find a solution, which limits the scalability of these approaches. To circumvent this combinatorial complexity, we introduce deep visual reasoning: based on a segmented initial image of the scene, a neural network directly predicts promising discrete action sequences such that ideally only one motion planning problem has to be solved to find a solution to the overall TAMP problem. Our method generalizes to scenes with many and varying numbers of objects, although being trained on only two objects at a time. This is possible by encoding the objects of the scene and the goal in (segmented) images as input to the neural network, instead of a fixed feature vector. We show that the framework can not only handle kinematic problems such as pick-and-place (as typical in TAMP), but also tool-use scenarios for planar pushing under quasi-static dynamic models. Here, the image-based representation enables generalization to other shapes than during training. Results show runtime improvements of several orders of magnitudes by, in many cases, removing the need to search over the discrete action sequences.",ar,2021-12-01,International Journal of Robotics Research,deep learning | deep Q-learning | logic geometric programming | offline reinforcement learning | physical reasoning | planar pushing | sequential manipulation | Task and motion planning,2-s2.0-85122335584,,,Article,Driess D.,60030569;60011604,Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems;Technical University of Berlin,Tubingen;Berlin,Germany;Germany,3,"Driess, Danny;Ha, Jung Su;Toussaint, Marc",57200627521;55433932800;7006246144,60011604-60030569;60011604-60030569;60011604-60030569,December 2021,2783649,18050,17413176,Journal,40,12-14,,1435-1466,1,DFG,EXC 2002/1–390523135,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1177/02783649211056967,,Excluido por machine. learning

The challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages.

NO,10.1016/j.rcim.2021.102199,Impedance controlled human–robot collaborative tooling for edge chamfering and polishing applications,"Surface finishing, as the final stage in the manufacturing pipeline, is a key process in determining the quality and life span of a product. Such a task is characterized by low contact forces and minimal material removal from the object surface. Despite the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, human workforce is still irreplaceable in performing such tasks due to superior dexterity and adaptability, but this is often prone to risks such as hand-arm vibration syndrome due to hand-held tools. Therefore, we propose a collaborative approach to assist the human in carrying out such tasks with the help of two case studies: Human–Robot-Collaborative edge chamfering and polishing tasks, based on an impedance controlled collaborative curve tracing technique. We propose a collaborative framework, where the robot assists an operator to guide the end-effector/tool along a pre-defined parametric curve. The algorithm is demonstrated in two scenarios. In the first case, we address a collaborative chamfering task whereas the second case focuses on a polishing application (for straight edges). For these kinds of tasks, the curve to be traced assumes the shape of a straight line along the edge. We make use of the compliant feature of a cobot, which allows the user to physically guide the robot in the task space, to generate a mathematical model for the tool path. From the end-user perspective, this is more intuitive than the classical programming-based path planning approaches. In the process of machining, to enhance the path tracking accuracy and to ensure constant tool-surface contact, we implement guidance virtual fixtures through impedance control. As a result, the machining error is reduced.",ar,2021-12-01,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,Edge chamfering | Edge polishing | Human Robot Collaboration | Impedance control | Virtual fixtures,2-s2.0-85107923236,S073658452100082X,,Article,Kana S.,60031307,School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Singapore City,Singapore,4,"Kana, Sreekanth;Lakshminarayanan, Srinivasan;Mohan, Dhanya Menoth;Campolo, Domenico",57202706860;57211169233;56647696800;15622892900,60031307;60031307;60031307;60031307,December 2021,7365845,18080,,Journal,72,,102199,,0,NRF,undefined,National Research Foundation Singapore,2,2021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073658452100082X?via%3Dihub,,Excluido por nada que ver
NO,10.1109/TIE.2020.3044776,Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Mobile Medical Robot Using Neural Optimization,"Mobile medical robots have been widely used in various structured scenarios, such as hospital drug delivery, public area disinfection, and medical examinations. Considering the challenge of environment modeling and controller design, how to achieve the information from the human demonstration in a structured environment directly arouse our interests. Learning skills is a powerful way that can reduce the complexity of algorithm in searching space. This is especially true when naturally acquiring new skills, as mobile medical robot must learn from the interaction with a human being or the environment with limited programming effort. In this article, a learning scheme with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed for mobile robot path tracking. The learning-by-imitation system consists of two levels of hierarchy: in the first level, a multivirtual spring-dampers system is presented for imitation of the mobile robot's trajectories; and in the second level, the NMPC method is used in the motion control system. The NMPC strategy utilizes a varying-parameter one-layer projection neural network to solve an online quadratic programming optimization via iteration over a limited receding horizon.

The prototype comprised a LiDAR, machine vision, GPS, flow meters, sensor fusion, and AI to scan trees for tree height, tree classification, and fruit counting. Specifically, this smart sensing system can detect and classify objects to tree or non-tree (e.g., human, field constructions), measure tree height and canopy density, and detect and count fruit. Based on this information, it controls spraying nozzles to optimize spraying applications. A novel software was written in C++ and ran on an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX embedded computer to process and control the data utilizing data fusion and AI techniques. The smart sensing system's results for tree height estimate indicated a relatively low average error of 6%. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to perform tree classification with an average accuracy of 84% in classifying the collected imagery into mature, young, dead, and non-tree objects. The fruit count module (also a CNN) had an F1 score of 89%, compared to ground-truth labeled images of mature and immature citrus fruits. Finally, the adoption of this new sensing method reduced spraying volume by 28%, compared to traditional spraying applications.",ar,2021-12-01,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,Machine learning | Precision agriculture | Sensor fusion | Smart sprayer | VRT,2-s2.0-85119424171,S0168169921005731,,Article,Partel V.,60010177,University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences,Gainesville,United States,3,"Partel, Victor;Costa, Lucas;Ampatzidis, Yiannis",57205375945;57215859659;25648879400,60010177;60010177;60010177,December 2021,1681699,30441,,Journal,191,,106556,,1,USDA,AM200100XXXXG037,U.S. Department of Agriculture,0,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.106556,,Excluido por AI

In a variety of cooperative modes, online path planning with obstacles avoidance is a fundamentally important hotspot, especially in a 3-D, complex, or dynamic environment. In the paper, an improved neural dynamics based approach with territorial mechanism is proposed to online path planning of MRS, which can be used as the online path planner for multi-AUVs and multi-UAVs in complex and dynamic environments. This approach integrates biological neural network, computational fluid dynamics, and territorial mechanism of animals, which has the characteristics and advantages of the biological nervous system, namely self-regulation, self-adaptation, self-organization, etc. It can cope with a variety of accidents during path planning, such as the disappearance of targets, the breakdown of robots, the change of environments, and so forth. Meanwhile, the proposed approach has better time performance and is insensitive to the number of robots in MRS. During the path planning of MRS, it can also guarantee to balance workload and to reduce entire workload and total time, which enhance robustness and fairness.

NO,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140857,TWO-LAYERS WORKSPACE: A NEW APPROACH TO COOPERATIVE OBJECT TRANSPORTATION WITH OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE FOR MULTI-ROBOT SYSTEM,"In this paper we present a new approach to cooperative overhead object transportation with obstacle avoidance for multi-robot systems. This approach considers situations in which there are obstacles that only pose a risk to the robots involved in the transport and not necessarily to the group of robots with the load. Thus, we propose to separate the workspace into two layers in a way that the obstacles which only pose risk of collision to the robots can be transposed by a local planner. This new approach to the load transportation problem allows the system to find shorter paths or even find a solution in situations which would not be possible with the classic approach. Furthermore, the developed method has a configuration space independent of the number of robots and it is robust to environmental variation, not reducing its performance in more complex environments as in narrow passages or long corridors.

NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3116700,Sim2real Learning of Obstacle Avoidance for Robotic Manipulators in Uncertain Environments,"Obstacle avoidance for robotic manipulators can be challenging when they operate in unstructured environments. This problem is probed with the sim-to-real (sim2real) deep reinforcement learning, such that a moving policy of the robotic arm is learnt in a simulator and then adapted to the real world. However, the problem of sim2real adaptation is notoriously difficult. To this end, this work proposes (1) a unified representation of obstacles and targets to capture the underlying dynamics of the environment while allowing generalization to unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model combining the unified representation with the deep reinforcement learning control module that can be trained by interacting with the environment. Such a representation is agnostic to the shape and appearance of the underlying objects, which simplifies and unifies the scene representation in both simulated and real worlds. We implement this idea with a vision-based actor-critic framework by devising a bounding box predictor module. The predictor estimates the 3D bounding boxes of obstacles and targets from the RGB-D input. The features extracted by the predictor are fed into the policy network, and all the modules are jointly trained. This makes the policy learn object-aware scene representation, which leads to a data-efficient learning of the obstacle avoidance policy. Our experiments in simulated environment and the real-world show that the end-to-end model of the unified representation achieves better sim2real adaption and scene generalization than state-of-the-art techniques.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,"collision avoidance | Planning under uncertainty | reinforcement learning | robotic manipulator, unified representation",2-s2.0-85116877007,,,Article,Zhang T.,60122037;60011873;60000937,Shenzhen Technology University;Oakland University;Shenzhen University,Shenzhen;Rochester;Shenzhen,China;United States;China,5,"Zhang, Tan;Zhang, Kefang;Lin, Jiatao;Louie, Wing Yue Geoffrey;Huang, Hui",57307243100;57292090500;57212652692;55515613600;55504198700,60122037;60000937;60000937;60011873;60000937,1 January 2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,7,1,,65-72,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555228,,Excluido por machine learning

Based on the statement mentioned above, a detailed survey has been conducted to highlight these challenges and identify potential solutions. In addition, the beneficial use of MRS is presented, as opposed to single robotic systems through the literature, and already-achievable industry-related results are provided.

The design of the corresponding models is difficult because of their complexity. Multi-agent systems cope with this problem by a divide-and-conquer approach. However, agent model design is still quite a challenge. In this paper, we propose a layered architecture for agents where each component is a kind of a stack-based state machine of our own. This model complements extended finite-state machines with some basic state stack operations that enable not only dealing with hierarchy but also with planning, which is a key element for belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents. Special care was taken to make the representation of these extended finite-state stack machines (EFS2M) simple so that their programming is straightforward. Through an educational example we show how such class of models are, and the potentiality of the solution. The taxi fleet simulation model is a metaphor for transportation systems in structured environments like factories or warehouses but can also be used as a vehicle traffic simulator. As for the latter case, we illustrate how it can be used to determine the efficiency and the quality of service of a taxi fleet in an urban area.",ar,2022-01-01,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Autonomous mobile robots | BDI agents | Cooperating robots | Finite-state stack machines | MAS | State-based modelling | Traffic simulation,2-s2.0-85123126052,,,Article,Ribas-Xirgo L.,60023020,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Cerdanyola del Valles,Spain,1,"Ribas-Xirgo, Lluís",6507245298,60023020,2022,13807501,25627,15737721,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11607-3,,Excluido por nada que ver

NO,10.1109/LRA.2022.3140449,SCVP: Learning One-shot View Planning via Set Covering for Unknown Object Reconstruction,"The view planning (VP) problem in robotic active vision enables a robot system to automatically perform object reconstruction tasks. Lacking prior knowledge, next-best-view (NBV) methods are usually used to plan a view sequence, with the goal of covering as many object surface areas as possible in an unknown environment. However, such methods have two problems: (1) they are unable to perform global path planning; and (2) the reconstruction process is inefficient because of time-consuming ray casting and high movement cost. We propose a neural network, SCVP, to pre-learn prior knowledge via set covering (SC) based training so as to achieve one-shot view planning. The SCVP network takes the volumetric occupancy grid as input, and directly predicts the minimum number of views that cover all surface areas. Given object 3D models as a priori geometric knowledge, the training dataset is automatically labeled by the set covering optimization method. We propose a global path planning method to reconstruct objects without redundant movement. Comparative experiments on multiple datasets of 3D models show that, under the condition of similar or better surface coverage, the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art NBV methods in terms of movement cost and inference time.

Recent work attempts to leverage the hierarchical structure of tasks via using action primitives. However, due to trajectory distribution shift, prior action primitives could hardly be adapted to new tasks. In this paper, we propose the layered action primitive planning from demonstration framework (LAPPLAND) to better utilize prior action primitives while maintaining behavior-interpretability. First, we pretrain goal-conditioned action primitives decoupled with a meta policy and an inverse dynamics model to facilitate interpretable goal state and reachable trajectory. Second, we decompose tasks with logical sub-structure into a sequence of prior action primitives and then align them for better adaption. Third, we execute the action primitives in sequence, conditioned on explicitly assigned goals to lead to the desired states. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments validate that robotic manipulation planning using LAPPLAND achieves a high success rate and is robust to the variation of the environment. We also compare LAPPLAND with three state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority.",ar,2022-01-01,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Learning from demonstraion | manipulation planning | Planning | Reinforcement learning | Robots | Supervised learning | Task analysis | task planning | Training | Trajectory,2-s2.0-85122561023,,,Article,Lin N.,60030835;60025345;60019118,University of Alberta;Guangzhou University;University of Science and Technology of China,Edmonton;Guangzhou;Hefei,Canada;China;China,8,"Lin, Nan;Li, Yuxuan;Tang, Keke;Zhu, Yujun;Wang, Ruolin;Ji, Jianmin;Chen, Xiaoping;Zhang, Xinming",57406369800;57221104390;57406800000;57213521106;57221093911;34869653800;36536786600;57406369900,60019118;60030835;60025345;60019118;60019118;60019118;60019118;60019118,2022,,21100900379,23773766,Journal,,,,,0,,undefined,,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3140127,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1109/LRA.2021.3125047,Learning Risk-Aware Costmaps for Traversability in Challenging Environments,"One of the main challenges in autonomous robotic exploration and navigation in unknown and unstructured environments is determining where the robot can or cannot safely move. A significant source of difficulty in this determination arises from stochasticity and uncertainty, coming from localization error, sensor sparsity and noise, difficult-to-model robot-ground interactions, and disturbances to the motion of the vehicle. Classical approaches to this problem rely on geometric analysis of the surrounding terrain, which can be prone to modeling errors and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, modeling the distribution of uncertain traversability costs is a difficult task, compounded by the various error sources mentioned above. In this work, we take a principled learning approach to this problem. We introduce a neural network architecture for robustly learning the distribution of traversability costs. Because we are motivated by preserving the life of the robot, we tackle this learning problem from the perspective of learning tail-risks, i.e. the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). We show that this approach reliably learns the expected tail risk given a desired probability risk threshold between 0 and 1, producing a traversability costmap which is more robust to outliers, more accurately captures tail risks, and is more computationally efficient, when compared against baselines.

However, a major limitation is that in practical applications, robots usually face dynamic obstacles such as pedestrian crowds. These dynamic objects create significant challenges for both collision-free navigation and accurate localization/mapping, which can compromise the safety and exploration performance of the robot. In this work, a hierarchical approach is proposed for both effective exploration and collision-free navigation in crowded environments. The central idea of our approach is to combine local and global information to ensure the safety and efficiency of the exploration planner. Besides, our planning method utilizes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based obstacle avoidance algorithm that allows the robot to safely follow the exploration planner's path through the pedestrian crowd.

NO,10.1007/s00170-021-08597-9,A modified Q-learning algorithm for robot path planning in a digital twin assembly system,"Product assembly is an important stage in complex product manufacturing. How to intelligently plan the assembly process based on dynamic product and environment information has become a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. For this reason, this research has constructed a digital twin assembly system, including virtual and real interactive feedback, data fusion analysis, and decision-making iterative optimization modules. In the virtual space, a modified Q-learning algorithm is proposed to solve the path planning problem in product assembly. The proposed algorithm speeds up the convergence speed by adding a dynamic reward function, optimizes the initial Q table by introducing knowledge and experience through the case-based reasoning algorithm, and prevents entry into the trapped area through the obstacle avoiding method. Finally, the six-joint robot UR10 is taken as an example to verify the performance of the algorithm in the three-dimensional pathfinding space. The experimental results show that the performance of the modified Q-learning algorithm is significantly better than the original Q-learning algorithm in both convergence efficiency and the optimization effect.",ar,2022-01-01,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,Case-based reasoning | Digital twin | Path planning | Q-learning,2-s2.0-85122703577,,,Article,Guo X.,60029311;60018273,University of Southern California;University of Science and Technology Beijing,Los Angeles;Beijing,United States;China,3,"Guo, Xiaowei;Peng, Gongzhuang;Meng, Yingying",57408988000;55855293400;57408642100,60029311;60018273;60018273,2022,2683768,20428,14333015,Journal,,,,,0,NSFC,61903031,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-021-08597-9,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1007/s12369-021-00849-8,Is a Wizard-of-Oz Required for Robot-Led Conversation Practice in a Second Language?,"The large majority of previous work on human-robot conversations in a second language has been performed with a human wizard-of-Oz. The reasons are that automatic speech recognition of non-native conversational speech is considered to be unreliable and that the dialogue management task of selecting robot utterances that are adequate at a given turn is complex in social conversations. This study therefore investigates if robot-led conversation practice in a second language with pairs of adult learners could potentially be managed by an autonomous robot. We first investigate how correct and understandable transcriptions of second language learner utterances are when made by a state-of-the-art speech recogniser. We find both a relatively high word error rate (41%) and that a substantial share (42%) of the utterances are judged to be incomprehensible or only partially understandable by a human reader. We then evaluate how adequate the robot utterance selection is, when performed manually based on the speech recognition transcriptions or autonomously using (a) predefined sequences of robot utterances, (b) a general state-of-the-art language model that selects utterances based on learner input or the preceding robot utterance, or (c) a custom-made statistical method that is trained on observations of the wizard’s choices in previous conversations. It is shown that adequate or at least acceptable robot utterances are selected by the human wizard in most cases (96%), even though the ASR transcriptions have a high word error rate. Further, the custom-made statistical method performs as well as manual selection of robot utterances based on ASR transcriptions. It was also found that the interaction strategy that the robot employed, which differed regarding how much the robot maintained the initiative in the conversation and if the focus of the conversation was on the robot or the learners, had marginal effects on the word error rate and understandability of the transcriptions but larger effects on the adequateness of the utterance selection. Autonomous robot-led conversations may hence work better with some robot interaction strategies.",ar,2022-01-01,International Journal of Social Robotics,Conversational practice | Dialogue management for spoken human-robot interaction | Non-native speech recognition | Robot-assisted language learning,2-s2.0-85122404446,,,Article,Engwall O.,60019656;60002014,Heriot-Watt University;The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Edinburgh;Stockholm,United Kingdom;Sweden,3,"Engwall, Olov;Lopes, José;Cumbal, Ronald",6506726055;55944443800;57216333110,60002014;60019656;60002014,2022,18754791,19500157063,18754805,Journal,,,,,1,VR,MAW 2020.0052,Vetenskapsrådet,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-021-00849-8,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
SI,10.1007/s13218-021-00752-4,What is the Problem? A Situated Account of Computational Thinking as Problem-Solving in Two Danish Preschools,"This paper presents a case study of in situ activities in two Danish preschools. In the activities, learning computational thinking (CT) plays a central part. The participating 4- to 5-year-old children are invited by an external educator to employ tangibles, such as robots, for structured problem-solving tasks within an overall narrative framing. In accordance with elaborations on CT as a problem-solving strategy, it is examined how the children engage in CT as problem-solving. The activities are part of a municipal initiative that involves preschools in a larger Danish city. The aim of this municipal initiative is to support young children’s understanding of technologies, coding and robotics as an element of twenty-first century skills. Based on video observations, the study provides a situated account of how the children engage in problem-solving in the observed activities. In empirical terms, the study shows how problem-solving tasks, such as programming a robot to move from A to B, merge with complex endeavors of engaging meaningfully with things and people in social situations. These empirical findings are analyzed by employing theoretical conceptualizations of problem-solving from a sociocultural perspective. This leads to a critical discussion regarding the relevance, potentials and pitfalls of introducing CT through problem-solving tasks with tangible tools in Danish preschool settings.",ar,2022-01-01,KI - Kunstliche Intelligenz,Computational thinking | Preschool | Problem-solving | Robots | Sociocultural theory,2-s2.0-85122800844,,,Article,Odgaard A.B.,60019160,Syddansk Universitet,Odense,Denmark,1,"Odgaard, Ane Bjerre",57202152118,60019160,2022,9331875,21101017166,16101987,Journal,,,,,0,DFF,undefined,Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13218-021-00752-4,,"Creo que puede servir pero no tengo el full article.

NO,10.1111/cgf.14435,A Stereo Matching Algorithm for High-Precision Guidance in a Weakly Textured Industrial Robot Environment Dominated by Planar Facets,"Although many algorithms perform very well on certain datasets, existing stereo matching algorithms still fail to obtain ideal disparity images with high precision in practical robotic applications with weak or untextured objects. This greatly limits the application of binocular vision for robotic arm guidance. Traditional stereo matching algorithms suffer from disparity loss, dilation and other problems, and deep learning algorithms have weakly generalization ability, making high-accuracy results impossible with non-training images. We propose an algorithm that uses segments and edges as matching units. We find the mapping relationship between two-dimensional images and three-dimensional scenes using segments. The algorithm obtains highly accurate results in industrial robotic applications with mainly planar facets. We combine it with a deep learning algorithm to obtain very good high-accuracy results in both general scenes and applications of industrial robots. The algorithm effectively improves the non-linear optimization ability of traditional algorithms and generalization ability of deep learning, and provides an effective method for the binocular vision guidance of industrial robotic scenes. We used the algorithm to guide the robot arm for threading with a success rate of 70%.",ar,2022-01-01,Computer Graphics Forum,,2-s2.0-85122296740,,,Article,Wei H.,60009860,Fudan University,Shanghai,China,2,"Wei, Hui;Meng, Lingjiang",7402516480;57397787400,60009860;60009860,2022,1677055,25023,14678659,Journal,,,,,0,NSFC,2017YFC1703303,National Natural Science Foundation of China,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14435,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.1007/s10514-021-10029-2,Decentralized probabilistic multi-robot collision avoidance using buffered uncertainty-aware Voronoi cells,"In this paper, we present a decentralized and communication-free collision avoidance approach for multi-robot systems that accounts for both robot localization and sensing uncertainties. The approach relies on the computation of an uncertainty-aware safe region for each robot to navigate among other robots and static obstacles in the environment, under the assumption of Gaussian-distributed uncertainty. In particular, at each time step, we construct a chance-constrained buffered uncertainty-aware Voronoi cell (B-UAVC) for each robot given a specified collision probability threshold. Probabilistic collision avoidance is achieved by constraining the motion of each robot to be within its corresponding B-UAVC, i.e. the collision probability between the robots and obstacles remains below the specified threshold. The proposed approach is decentralized, communication-free, scalable with the number of robots and robust to robots’ localization and sensing uncertainties. We applied the approach to single-integrator, double-integrator, differential-drive robots, and robots with general nonlinear dynamics. Extensive simulations and experiments with a team of ground vehicles, quadrotors, and heterogeneous robot teams are performed to analyze and validate the proposed approach.",ar,2022-01-01,Autonomous Robots,Collision avoidance | Motion planning | Multi-robot systems | Planning under uncertainty,2-s2.0-85123483318,,,Article,Zhu H.,60118240,"Department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft",Delft,Netherlands,3,"Zhu, Hai;Brito, Bruno;Alonso-Mora, Javier",57205189246;57211022915;37057150200,60118240;60118240;60118240,2022,9295593,18016,15737527,Journal,,,,,0,NWO,15916,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-021-10029-2,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.3389/fbioe.2021.793782,Genetic Algorithm-Based Trajectory Optimization for Digital Twin Robots,"Mobile robots have an important role in material handling in manufacturing and can be used for a variety of automated tasks. The accuracy of the robot’s moving trajectory has become a key issue affecting its work efficiency. This paper presents a method for optimizing the trajectory of the mobile robot based on the digital twin of the robot. The digital twin of the mobile robot is created by Unity, and the trajectory of the mobile robot is trained in the virtual environment and applied to the physical space. The simulation training in the virtual environment provides schemes for the actual movement of the robot. Based on the actual movement data returned by the physical robot, the preset trajectory of the virtual robot is dynamically adjusted, which in turn enables the correction of the movement trajectory of the physical robot. The contribution of this work is the use of genetic algorithms for path planning of robots, which enables trajectory optimization of mobile robots by reducing the error in the movement trajectory of physical robots through the interaction of virtual and real data. It provides a method to map learning in the virtual domain to the physical robot.",ar,2022-01-10,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,digital twin | genetic algorithm | mobile robot | trajectory optimization | virtual model,2-s2.0-85123342920,,,Article,Liu X.,60014643;60010580,Wuhan University of Science and Technology;China Three Gorges University,Wuhan;Yichang,China;China,9,"Liu, Xin;Jiang, Du;Tao, Bo;Jiang, Guozhang;Sun, Ying;Kong, Jianyi;Tong, Xiliang;Zhao, Guojun;Chen, Baojia",57410412900;57194035495;54785420900;14919387200;57191647189;57327145900;57242768700;57410848200;23110036300,60014643;60014643;60014643;60014643;60014643;60014643;60014643;60014643;60010580,10 January 2022,,21100835954,22964185,Journal,9,,793782,,1,NSFC,2020KJX02,Hubei Provincial Department of Education,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2021.793782,,Excluido por no robótica educativa
NO,10.3390/electronics11030402,Automatic RTL Generation Tool of FPGAs for DNNs,"With the increasing use of multi‐purpose artificial intelligence of things (AIOT) devices, embedded field‐programmable gate arrays (FPGA) represent excellent platforms for deep neural network (DNN) acceleration on edge devices. FPGAs possess the advantages of low latency and high energy efficiency, but the scarcity of FPGA development resources challenges the deployment of DNN‐based edge devices. Register‐transfer level programming, hardware verification, and pre-cise resource allocation are needed to build a high‐performance FPGA accelerator for DNNs. These tasks present a challenge and are time consuming for even experienced hardware developers. There-fore, we propose an automated, collaborative design process employing an automatic design space exploration tool; an automatic DNN engine enables the tool to reshape and parse a DNN model from software to hardware. We also introduce a long short‐term memory (LSTM)‐based model to predict performance and generate a DNN model that suits the developer requirements automati-cally. We demonstrate our design scheme with three FPGAs: a zcu104, a zcu102, and a Cyclone V SoC (system on chip).

NO,10.3390/s22030941,An Experimental Safety Response Mechanism for an Autonomous Moving Robot in a Smart Manufacturing Environment Using Q-Learning Algorithm and Speech Recognition,"The industrial manufacturing sector is undergoing a tremendous revolution moving from traditional production processes to intelligent techniques. Under this revolution, known as Industry 4.0 (I40), a robot is no longer static equipment but an active workforce to the factory production alongside human operators. Safety becomes crucial for humans and robots to ensure a smooth production run in such environments. The loss of operating moving robots in plant evacuation can be avoided with the adequate safety induction for them. Operators are subject to frequent safety inductions to react in emergencies, but very little is done for robots. Our research proposes an experimental safety response mechanism for a small manufacturing plant, through which an autonomous robot learns the obstacle-free trajectory to the closest safety exit in emergencies. We implement a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, Q-learning, to enable the path learning abilities of the robot. After obtaining the robot optimal path selection options with Q-learning, we code the outcome as a rule-based system for the safety response. We also program a speech recognition system for operators to react timeously, with a voice command, to an emergency that requires stopping all plant activities even when they are far away from the emergency stops (ESTOPs) button. An ESTOP or a voice command sent directly to the factory central controller can give the factory an emergency signal. We tested this functionality on real hardware from an S7-1200 Siemens programmable logic controller (PLC). We simulate a simple and small manufacturing environment overview to test our safety procedure. Our results show that the safety response mechanism successfully generates paths without obstacles to the closest safety exits from all the factory locations. Our research benefits any manufacturing SME intending to implement the initial and primary use of autonomous moving robots (AMR) in their factories. It also impacts manufacturing SMEs using legacy devices such as traditional PLCs by offering them intelligent strategies to incorporate current state-of-the-art technologies such as speech recognition to improve their performances. Our research empowers SMEs to adopt advanced and innovative technological concepts within their operations.",ar,2022-02-01,Sensors,Autonomous moving robot | Obstacle-free path planning | Q-learning algorithm | Reinforcement learning (RL) | Safety response | Smart manufacturing | Speech recognition,2-s2.0-85123351962,,,Article,Kiangala K.S.,60002397,University of South Africa,Pretoria,South Africa,2,"Kiangala, Kahiomba Sonia;Wang, Zenghui",57202162378;7410034341,60002397;60002397,February-1 2022,14248220,130124,,Journal,22,3,941,,1,NRF,112108,National Research Foundation,0,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22030941,,Excluido por no educación

SI,10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104431,The role of feedback and guidance as intervention methods to foster computational thinking in educational robotics learning activities for primary school,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered an emerging competence domain linked to 21st-century competences, and educational robotics (ER) is increasingly recognised as a tool to develop CT competences. This is why researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on integrating ER activities. The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students’ CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities. Subject to delayed feedback, students are better at formulating the robot behaviour to be programmed, and, thus, such a strategy reinforces the anticipation process underlying the CT.",ar,2022-04-01,Computers and Education,21st-century abilities | Collaborative learning | Elementary education | Improving classroom teaching | Teaching/learning strategies,2-s2.0-85122614192,S0360131522000021,,Article,Chevalier M.,60110693;60101870;60028186;101404739,Université Côte d'Azur;Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana;Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;Haute École pédagogique du canton de Vaud,Nice;Manno;Lausanne;Lausanne,France;Switzerland;Switzerland;Switzerland,10,"Chevalier, Morgane;Giang, Christian;El-Hamamsy, Laila;Bonnet, Evgeniia;Papaspyros, Vaios;Pellet, Jean Philippe;Audrin, Catherine;Romero, Margarida;Baumberger, Bernard;Mondada, Francesco",56038487900;57204360363;57219702090;57191821370;57210558689;56884212500;57193897804;36698221700;6603299372;6603066571,60028186-101404739;60028186-60101870;60028186;60028186;60028186;101404739;101404739;60110693;101404739;60028186,April 2022,3601315,17645,,Journal,180,,104431,,1,SNF,undefined,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,0,2022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131522000021?via%3Dihub,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QuxLtLq2Rnqx9F9ULDT3vqoMf7kRhsXU/view?usp=sharing,"No se si sirva específicamente para el estado del arte porque no estoy seguro de que mencionen alguna herramienta específica pero sí puede ser interesante para justificar cuestiones relacionadas con el feedback instantáneo que da Physical Bits
