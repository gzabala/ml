Moreover, users who want to dive in the research field of drone swarms often need to interface with multiple programming languages. We present SwarmLab, a software entirely written in MATLAB, that aims at the creation of standardized processes and metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of swarm algorithms, and in particular, it focuses on drones. We showcase the functionalities of SwarmLab by comparing two decentralized algorithms from the state of the art for the navigation of aerial swarms in cluttered environments, Olfati-Saber's and Vasarhelyi's. We analyze the variability of the inter-agent distances and agents' speeds during flight. We also study some of the performance metrics presented, i.e. order, inter- and extra-agent safety, union, and connectivity. While Olfati-Saber's approach results in a faster crossing of the obstacle field, Vasarhelyi's approach allows the agents to fly smoother trajectories, without oscillations. We believe that SwarmLab is relevant for both the biological and robotics research communities, and for education, since it allows fast algorithm development, the automatic collection of simulated data, the systematic analysis of swarming behaviors with performance metrics inherited from the state of the art.",Aerial Systems: Applications | Agent-Based Systems | Simulation and Animation | Swarms,4,0,Relevant

We describe a new, open-source robotics simulation software package that is nearing completion. This free software is targeted for educators and students at the high school, community college, and university level. We expect that the software will be particularly useful for two- or four-year Electrical Engineering Technology degree programs. Our software allows students to learn how to operate robot even when access to a real robot is impossible, expensive, or limited. Similar to expensive proprietary robot simulation software, our simulator focuses on providing the basics of operating a robot, setting up and using coordinate frames, programming effector paths, and allows the robot to interact with objects in the environment. The software also simulates a teach pendant which the student uses to control the robot. A preliminary version of this work was presented at ASEE 2016 and this paper describes the significant improvements made to the software in the past year. Recent improvements include a revamped inverse kinematics system which provides smoother and more realistic robot movement, collision detection, and significantly improved teach pendant menus. Programming capabilities have also been expanded to include register expressions, conditional statements, and new instructions. Finally, our software now includes scenarios which creates predefined situations aimed at teaching specific robotics skills while also allowing students to create their own scenarios with an interactive menu system. A beta version of the software has been publicly released and we are excited to collect feedback from those in the robotics education community.

However, its application to robotics education presents challenges as physical access to hardware is typically required. While educational robotics simulation platforms exist, most are limited in scope or do not facilitate remote collaboration well. This paper proposes a novel networked robotics simulator for education, where students are able to collaborate in a shared 3D virtual space their robots inhabit. The framework combines these simulated worlds with a block-based programming environment to enable distance robotics education for a wider audience. The users' programs run in a web browser on their computers and they issue commands to the virtual robots through a network protocol abstracted to simple-to-use blocks. Robots send back acknowledgements and sensor values through the same protocol. Interactive environments provide students with a more immersive educational experience, and allow for automatically evaluating student performance. In addition to sharing the virtual worlds remotely, students can also develop their programs together since the block-based environment supports both synchronous and asynchronous remote collaboration.

This provides the students with the foundation of coding, algorithms, and refining their ideas to produce a working mobile phone app that is created to meet a specified challenge. The second program is called Creative Fusion and Innovation (CFI). In this program, the students learned the basics of creating, editing, and analyzing their 3D designs; recognize the importance of creating 3D models in engineering; and understand how 3D printing works as they create their own 3D models. The third program is called Virtual Robotics Games (VRG). In this program, the students learn the fundamentals of designing, building, programming, and testing robots in a virtual environment. Through this program, the students learn the basics of robot design in addition to coding and simulation, which are all necessary tools for aspiring engineers. These programs aim to provide STEM education access to build communities specifically in engineering, which is in high demand. Throughout these programs, the students are able to learn important computer skills and the concepts of the engineering design process. The programs also equip them with the required knowledge and problem-solving skills to tackle challenges. At the end of each program, the students will have created successful designs as solutions to the real-life problems that they were tasked with. In this paper, the details behind the planning, formation and production, and implementation of the three online programs are presented.",3D Modeling | Engineering Design | Mobile App Development | Online | Outreach | Pre-College (K–12) STEM | Program Development | Robotics | STEM Education,0,0,Relevant

The comparison of the simulators is aimed at establishing the range of applications for which these are best suited as well as their accuracy for certain simulation tasks. The simulators chosen for detailed comparison were selected considering their level of maturity, modularity, and popularity among engineers and researchers. The qualitative comparison included a discussion of relevant features. The quantitative analysis entailed the development of a detailed dynamical model of a mobile robot on a road with varying slope. This model was used as benchmark to compare the accuracy of each simulator. The validity of the simulated results was also contrasted against measurements obtained from experiments with a real robot. This research and analysis should be very valuable to educators, engineers, and researchers who are always seeking adequate tools for simulating autonomous mobile robots.",Comparative survey | Mobile robot dynamics | Mobile robots | Physics engine | Simulation software,16,0,Relevant

From the point of view of the authors, some of these negative results could be because teachers do not receive any guidance on how to incorporate the use of simulations in their teaching strategy. This paper reports the evaluation of a platform to simulate industrial robots based on the MATLAB™ and Simulink™ environment. The platform was used by 3 teachers of undergraduate robotics courses. Each teacher was trained how to use the platform. For teachers of groups A and B, in addition to this training, they also received guidance on how to use the platform in their classes, while the teacher of group C freely decided on his own how to use the platform in his classes. In each group, the teacher covered the same topics about forward kinematics, and the same exercises were given to the students to solve during the practical sessions. As a result, students in groups A and B attained better academic performance compared to students of group C.

Current surgical education relies heavily on simulation. Several assessment tools are available to the trainee, including the actual robotic simulator assessment metrics and the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) metrics, both of which have been independently validated. GEARS is a rating scale through which human evaluators can score trainees’ performances on 6 domains: depth perception, bimanual dexterity, efficiency, force sensitivity, autonomy, and robotic control. Each domain is scored on a 5-point Likert scale with anchors. We used 2 common robotic simulators, the dV-Trainer (dVT; Mimic Technologies Inc., Seattle, WA) and the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS; Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA), to compare the performance metrics of robotic surgical simulators with the GEARS for a basic robotic task on each simulator. Design: A prospective single-blinded randomized study. Setting: A surgical education and training center. Participants: Surgeons and surgeons in training. Interventions: Demographic information was collected including sex, age, level of training, specialty, and previous surgical and simulator experience. Subjects performed 2 trials of ring and rail 1 (RR1) on each of the 2 simulators (dVSS and dVT) after undergoing randomization and warm-up exercises. The second RR1 trial simulator performance was recorded, and the deidentified videos were sent to human reviewers using GEARS. Eight different simulator assessment metrics were identified and paired with a similar performance metric in the GEARS tool. The GEARS evaluation scores and simulator assessment scores were paired and a Spearman rho calculated for their level of correlation. Measurements and Main Results: Seventy-four subjects were enrolled in this randomized study with 9 subjects excluded for missing or incomplete data. There was a strong correlation between the GEARS score and the simulator metric score for time to complete versus efficiency, time to complete versus total score, economy of motion versus depth perception, and overall score versus total score with rho coefficients greater than or equal to 0.70; these were significant (p <.0001). Those with weak correlation (rho ≥0.30) were bimanual dexterity versus economy of motion, efficiency versus master workspace range, bimanual dexterity versus master workspace range, and robotic control versus instrument collisions. Conclusion: On basic VR tasks, several simulator metrics are well matched with GEARS scores assigned by human reviewers, but others are not.

Robotic ultrasonic welding virtual reality laboratory is developed as an educational project and laboratory component for undergraduate engineering curricula. Ultrasonic welding is a relatively fast, clean process that does not require adhesives, binding agents, solders, fluxes, or solvents. However, it can only be done either by an experienced welder or a welding robot since it is difficult to weld due to high-frequency mechanical vibration and complex welding path. This paper explores the use of virtual reality simulation of industrial robots and its application in the field of industrial design and automation with lab-on-a-chip devices. With a virtual reality based welding simulator, learning ultrasonic welding can be made easier and faster. Accordingly, educational approaches that combine and integrate multiple disciplines afford more efficient and effective use of time and resources.

This reaction carries important information about an affected location. Training physicians to regulate palpation forces to elicit just enough muscle tension is a challenge using real patients. Tunable stiffness mechanisms enabled by soft robotics can be effectively integrated into medical simulator designs for effective clinical education. In this paper, we propose a controllable stiffness muscle layer to simulate guarding for abdominal palpation training. Designs with soft, fine, and rigid granular jamming, stretchable and non-stretchable layer jamming mechanisms were tested and evaluated as methods to create controllable stiffness muscle. User studies have been carried out on 10 naive participants to differentiate the tense and relaxed abdomen with the proposed jamming mechanisms. Muscle samples made of ground coffee (fine granular jamming) and latex layers (stretchable layer jamming) show good usability in simulating abdomen with different stiffness with at least 75% of the user data exhibits more than 70% of decision accuracy for both tested palpation gestures (single finger and multiple fingers) after short pretraining.",,1,0,Not relevant

A motion control architecture is designed for Kian-I in this study to facilitate accurate navigation for the robot in an immersive environment. The implemented control structure consists of two main components of the path recommender system and trajectory tracking controller. Given partial knowledge about the operation field, the path recommender system adopts B-spline curves and particle swarm optimization algorithm to determine a collision-free path curve with translational velocity constraint. The provided optimal reference path feeds into the trajectory tracking controller enabling Kian-I to navigate autonomously in the operating field. The trajectory tracking module eliminates the error between the desired path and the followed trajectory through controlling the wheels’ velocity. To assess the feasibility of the proposed control architecture, the performance of Kian-I robot in autonomous navigation from any arbitrary initial pose to a target of interest is evaluated through numerous simulation and experimental studies.

The purpose of this study was to compare the educational efficacy of the TS app with a traditional paper-based learning program in performing a robotic arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Twelve participants (four interns, four residents, four adult reconstructive fellows) were randomized to a paper-based technique guide or learning modules from the Mako Partial Knee (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) TS app. Trainees were subjected to a baseline pretest. After preparing with the allocated training tool, participants completed an immediate posttest followed by a retention test administered 3 weeks later. The TS simulation group demonstrated greater improvement (22% score increase; p = 0.001) in posttest assessment compared with the control group (10% score increase; p = 0. 09). The TS simulation group demonstrated better information recall compared with the control group based on the score differential following the 3-week retention test.

We then develop a versatile EKF-based online localization system which optimally (up to linearization) fuses multi-modal information provided by the pre-built occupancy grid map, IMU, odometry, and 2D LiDAR measurements with low computational requirements. Importantly, spatiotemporal calibration between these sensors are also estimated online to account for poor initial calibration and make the system more ""plug-and-play"", which improves both the accuracy and flexibility of the proposed multi-sensor fusion framework. In our experiments, our mapping system is shown to be more accurate than the state-of-the-art Google Cartographer.

Of course, interest in synthesising human speech has been driven by the demand for practical applications such as reading machines for the blind or voiceoperated assistants. Nevertheless, there are potential uses for non-human vocal synthesis: e.g. in education, robotics or ecological fieldwork. The latter is of particular interest, since it is common practice to use 'playback' methods (based on recorded samples) that do not easily facilitate parametric control over key experimental variables. Therefore, this paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time parametric generalpurpose mammalian vocal synthesiser. The approach taken has been to decompose the overall sound production system into the relevant anatomical components (such as the lungs, vocal folds, tongue and mouth), and to implement a real-time simulation in 'Pure Data' - an open-source dataflow programming language.

This study proposes a care training assistant robot (CaTARo) system with 3D facial pain expression that simulates an elderly person for improving the skills of workers in elderly care. First, in order to develop an accurate and efficient system for elderly care training, this study introduces a fuzzy logic–based care training evaluation method that can calculate the pain level of a robot for giving the feedback. Elderly caregivers and trainees performed the range of motion exercise using the proposed CaTARo. We obtained quantitative data from CaTARo, and the pain level was calculated by combining four key parameters using the fuzzy logic method. Second, we developed a 3D facial avatar for use in CaTARo that is capable of expressing pain based on the UNBC-McMaster Pain Shoulder Archive, and we then generated four pain groups with respect to the pain level. To mimic the conditions for care training with actual humans, we designed the system to provide pain feedback based on the opinions of experts. The pain feedback was expressed in real time by using a projector and a 3D facial mask during care training.

Surgical cricothyroidotomy is an essential skill for immediate airway management in trauma. Training for surgical cricothyroidotomy has been undertaken using simulators, cadavers or animal models. The ideal approach to training for this low volume and high-risk procedure is unknown. We hypothesized that current simulation technology provides an equal or better education for surgical cricothyroidotomy when compared with animal tissue training. Methods We performed a prospective randomized controlled study comparing training for surgical cricothyroidotomy using hands-on training on swine versus inanimate manikin. We enrolled medical students who had never performed or had formal instruction on surgical cricothyroidotomy. We randomized their instruction to use either a swine model or the inanimate version of the Operative Experience Inc. advanced surgical manikin. Participants' skills were then evaluated on human cadavers and on an advanced robotic manikin. Tests were scored using checklists modified from Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills and Tactical Combat Casualty Care. We compared scores between the groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and generalized linear models. Results Forty-eight participants were enrolled and trained; 30 participants completed the first testing session; 25 completed the second testing session. The mean time to establish an airway from the incision until the cuff was blown up was 95±52 s. There were no significant differences in any of the outcome measures between the two training groups. Discussion Measured performance was not different between subjects trained to perform surgical cricothyroidotomy on an animal model or a high fidelity manikin.

As the use of robotic surgery has increased, so has the interest in the surgical training of gynecologic oncology fellows. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state of robotic surgical education in Gynecologic Oncology. Methods Several electronic databases were searched to identify studies that discussed robotic surgical education in gynecologic oncology. Particular attention was given to articles that discussed educational curriculum. The various curriculums were compared and summarized. Results The first reports of robotic surgery curriculums in gynecologic oncology emerged in 2008. Prior to that the early adapters had to rely on less structured curriculums that essentially used live animal models and cadaveric dissections on the robot to simulate live surgery. More recent surgical curriculums are more structured and include the same basic components: didactics and a graduated hands-on experience. There is also an accredited robotic educational curriculum, the Fundamentals of Robotic Surgery (FRS), which combine an on-line curriculum with dry lab and operating room components that can be scored using a validated assessment tool. Conclusions Robotic surgical education has come a long way in the decade that the robotic platform has been available in the U.S. Although there is still no standardized curriculum, most fellowship training programs in gynecologic oncology have fairly consistent training.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate our curriculum and evaluation system, which was designed to achieve a standardized format for education in general robotic surgery. Methods: The curriculum consists of two phases: phase 1 (PGY 1–2): Complete 4 robotic surgery training modules; read two assigned robotic surgery articles; and practice simulation modules on the robot. phase 2 (PGY 3–5): Refresh training modules, score >90% on the simulator modules every 6 months; bedside assist minimum of 4 robotic procedures; and act as console surgeon for a minimum of 10 procedures with 2 separate attending surgeons. The required simulator modules were specially selected to incorporate all of the skills categories documented in the simulator. The faculty evaluate the resi-dent’s operative performance using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills validated rubric. Results: Since the curriculum was instituted in June 2017, 73 evaluations from 8 surgeons have been collected. We examined data from 6 residents who had at least 5 Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills assessments completed. Correlation coefficient scores showed a positive correlation ranging from 0.476 to 0.862 for average skills and 0.334 to 0.866 for overall performance scores.

However, it is unknown how these advances have impacted the cost of care. PURPOSE: Compare the economic outcomes of lumbar spine fusion between open, MIS, and robot-assisted surgery patients. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of a single center spine surgery database. PATIENT SAMPLE: Three hundred sixty propensity matched patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, EuroQol-5D (EQ5D), cost per quality adjusted life years (QALY). METHODS: Inclusion criteria: surgical patients >18 years undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. Patients were categorized into 3 groups based on procedure type: open, MIS, or robotic. Open patients undergoing poster spinal fusion were considered as the control group. MIS patients included those undergoing transforaminal or lateral lumbar interbody fusion with percutaneous screws. Robotic patients were those undergoing robot-assisted fusion. Propensity score matching was performed between all groups for the number of levels fused. Costs were calculated using the PearlDiver database, which reflects both private insurance and Medicare reimbursement claims for ICD-9 codes. For robotic cases, costs were reflective of operational fees and initial purchase cost. Complications and comorbidities and major complications and comorbidities were assessed according to CMS.gov manual definitions. QALYs and cost per QALY were calculated using a 3% discount rate to account for residual decline to life expectancy (78.7 years). Costs per QALY were calculated for both 1 year and life expectancy, assuming no loss of benefit. A 10,000 trial Monte Carlo simulation with probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) assessed our model parameters and costs. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty propensity matched patients (120 open, 120 MIS, 120 robotic) met inclusion criteria. Descriptive statistics for the cohort were: age 58.8±13.5, 50% women, BMI 29.4±6.3, operative time 294.4±119.0, LOS 4.56±3.31 days, estimated blood loss 515.9±670.0 cc, and 2.3±2.2 average levels fused. Rates of post-op complications were significantly higher in robotic cases versus open and MIS (43% vs. 21% and 22% for open and MIS, p<.05). However, revision rates were comparable between all groups (3% open, 3% MIS, 5% robotic, p>.05). After factoring in complications, revisions, and purchasing and operating fees, the costs of robotic cases was significantly higher than both open and MIS surgery ($60,047.01 vs. $42,538.98 open and $41,471.21 MIS). In a subanalysis of 42 patients with baseline (BL) and 1Y EQ5D data, the cost per QALY at 1Y for open, MIS, and robot-assisted cases was $296,624.48, $115,911.69, and $592,734.30. If utility gained was sustained to life expectancy, the cost per QALY was $14,905.75, $5,824.71, $29,785.64 for open, MIS, and robot-assisted cases. Results of the PSA were consistent with MIS surgery having the most incremental cost effectiveness when compared to open and robotic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous advances have been made in the field of spine surgery, however, there has been limited discussion of the effect these advances have on economic outcomes. When matched for levels fused, robot-assisted surgery patients had significantly higher rates of complications and 30% higher costs of surgery compared to minimally invasive and open spine surgery patients. While 1 year economic outcomes were not optimal for robotic surgery cases, the projected costs per QALYs at life expectancy were well below established acceptable thresholds. The above findings may be reflective of an educational learning curve and emerging surgical technologies undergoing progressive refinement.",Cost effectiveness | Costs | Health related quality of life | Lumbar fusion | MIS | Robotic surgery,4,0,Not relevant

Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) and robotics are being increasingly used in different clinical contexts and require supporting education and training, which must begin within the medical school. There is currently a large discrepancy between the high demand and the number of scientifically proven concepts. The aim of this thesis was the conceptual design and structured evaluation of a newly developed learning/teaching concept for the digital transformation of medicine, with a special focus on the influence of surgical teaching. Methods Thirty-five students participated in three courses of the blended learning curriculum Medicine in the digital age. The 4th module of this course deals with virtual reality, augmented reality and robotics in surgery. It is divided into the following course parts: (1) immersive surgery simulation of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, (2) liver surgery planning using AR/VR, (3) basic skills on the VR simulator for robotic surgery, (4) collaborative surgery planning in virtual space and (5) expert discussion. After completing the overall curriculum, a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the course concept was carried out by means of semi-structured interviews and standardised pre-/post-evaluation questionnaires. Results In the qualitative evaluation procedure of the interviews, 79 text statements were assigned to four main categories. The largest share (35%) was taken up by statements on the expert discussion, which the students consider to be an elementary part of the course concept. In addition, the students perceived the course as a horizon-widening learning experience (29% of the statements) with high practical relevance (27%). The quantitative student evaluation shows a positive development in the three sub-competences knowledge, skills and attitude. Conclusion Surgical teaching can be profitably used to develop digital skills. The speed of the change process of digital transformation in the surgical specialty must be considered.

Simulation-based training is ideal for filling this gap in training. Objective The objective of the study was to design a surgical model for training in laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure and to present evidence of its validity and reliability as an assessment and training tool. Study Design Participants included gynecology staff and trainees at 2 tertiary care centers. Experienced surgeons were also recruited at the combined International Urogynecologic Association and American Urogynecologic Society scientific meeting. Participants included 19 experts and 21 trainees. All participants were recorded using the laparoscopic hysterectomy cuff closure simulation model. The model was constructed using the an advanced uterine manipulation system with a sacrocolopexy tip/vaginal stent, a vaginal cuff constructed from neoprene material and lined with a swimsuit material (nylon and spandex) secured to the vaginal stent with a plastic cable tie. The uterine manipulation system was attached to the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery laparoscopic training box trainer using a metal bracket. Performance was evaluated using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills scale. In addition, needle handling, knot tying, and incorporation of epithelial edge were also evaluated. The Student t test was used to compare the scores and the operating times between the groups. Intrarater reliability between the scores by the 2 masked experts was measured using the interclass correlation coefficient. Results Total and annual experience with laparoscopic suturing and specifically vaginal cuff closure varied greatly among the participants. For the construct validity, the participants in the expert group received significantly higher scores in each of the domains of the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills Scale and for each of the 3 added items than did the trainees. The median total Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills Scale score (maximum 20) for the experts was 18.8 (range, 11-20), whereas the median total Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills Scale score for the trainees was 10 (range, 8-18) (P =.001). The overall score that included the 3 new domains (maximum 35) was 33 (range, 18-35) for the experts and 17.5 (range, 14-31.5) for trainees (P =.001). For the face validity testing, the majority of the study participants (32 [85%]) agreed or strongly agreed that the model is realistic and all participants agreed or strongly agreed that the model appears to be useful for improving technique required for this task. For the interrater reliability, the scores assigned by each observer had an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.93).

This, together with the waning interest in surgery as a career among medical students, is a serious issue confronted by hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. We, therefore, developed and implemented an intensive one-day surgical-skill training course for two purposes; it would improve surgical skills and increase interest in surgery among medical students. Methods: The surgical-skill training program is named Surgical Skill Weekend (SSW) and it includes hands-on training sessions for surgical-suturing techniques and advanced surgical procedures (i.e. laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery), hybrid simulation sessions, and an operating-room session where aforementioned sessions are all put together. By the end of the program, students' improvements in surgical-suturing skills were assessed by experts in a form of checklist, and changes in the interest in a surgical career, if there were any, were answered by the students who participated in the program. Results: A total of ninety-one (91) medical students participated in the 2015 and 2016 SSW courses. Their overall satisfaction level with the course was very high (Very satisfied: 78%, Quite satisfied: 22%).

Methods: New (n = 18), intermediate (n = 8), and experienced (n = 13) surgeons completed 25 virtual reality simulation exercises on the da Vinci Surgical System. Three camera metrics were computed for all exercises and compared to conventional efficiency measures. Results: Both camera metrics and efficiency metrics showed construct validity (p < 0.05) across most exercises (camera movement frequency 23/25, camera movement duration 22/25, camera movement interval 19/25, overall score 24/25, completion time 25/25). Camera metrics differentiated new and experienced surgeons across all tasks as well as efficiency metrics. Finally, camera metrics significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with completion time (camera movement frequency 21/25, camera movement duration 21/25, camera movement interval 20/25) and overall score (camera movement frequency 20/25, camera movement duration 19/25, camera movement interval 20/25) for most exercises.

The aim of this study was to analyse the current status of digitalisation and its influence in surgery, with a special focus on surgical education and training. Methods: An individually created questionnaire was used to analyse the subjective assessment of the digitalisation processes in clinical surgery. The online questionnaire consisted of 16 questions regarding the importance and the corresponding implementation of the teaching content: big data, health apps, messenger apps, telemedicine, data protection/IT security, ethics, simulator training, economics and e‑Learning were included. The participation link was sent to members of the German Society of Surgery via the e‑Mail distribution list. Results: In total, 119 surgeons (response rate = 19.8%) took part in the survey: 18.5% of them were trainees (TR), and 81.5% had already completed specialist training (SP). Overall, 66.4% confirmed a positive influence of digitalisation on the quality of patient care. The presence of a surgical robot was confirmed by 47.9% of the participants. A further 22.0% (n = 26) of the participants confirmed the possibility of using virtual simulators. According to 79.0% of the participants, the integration of digital technologies in surgical education for basic and advanced stage surgeons should be aimed for. Data protection (1.7) and e‑Learning (1.7) were rated as the most important teaching content. The greatest discrepancy between importance and implementation was seen in the teaching content of big data (mean: 2.2–3.8). Conclusion: The results of the survey reveal the particular importance of digitalisation content for surgery, surgical education and training. At the same time, the results underline the desire for increased integration of digital competence teaching. The data also show an overall more progressive and optimistic perception of TR. In order to meet the challenges of the digital transformation, the implementation of suitable curricula, including virtual simulation-based training and blended-learning teaching concepts, should be emphasised.",Artificial intelligence | Data literacy | Digital leadership | Digital transformation | Robotic | Surgical training | Virtual reality,0,0,Not relevant

There are very few reports on the use of robotic approach in sleeve gastrectomy. Objectives: The purpose of this retrospective study is to report our early experience of robotic-assisted laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (RALSG) using a proctored training model with comparison to an institutional cohort of patients who underwent laparoscopic hand-assisted sleeve gastrectomy (LASG). Settings: University hospital. Methods: The study included 108 patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy either via the laparoscopic-assisted or robot-assisted approach during the study period. Of these 108 patients, 62 underwent LASG and 46 underwent RALSG. The console surgeon in the RALSG is a clinical year 4 (CY4) surgery resident. All CY4 surgery residents received targeted simulation training before their rotation. The console surgeon is proctored by the primary surgeon with assistance as needed by the second surgeon. Results: The patients in the robotic and laparoscopic cohorts did not have a statistical difference in their demographic characteristics, preoperative co-morbidities, or complications. The mean operating time did not differ significantly between the 2 cohorts (121 min versus 110 min, P = .07). Patient follow-up in the LSG and RALSG were 91% and 90% at 3 months, 62% and 64% at 6 months, and 60% and 55% at 1 year, respectively. The mean percentage estimated weight loss (EWL%) at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year was greater in the robotic group but not statistically significant (27 versus 22 at 3 mo [P = .05] and 39 versus 34 at 6 mo [P = .025], 57 versus 48 at 1 yr [P = .09]).

Numerous NTS rating systems have been developed to support effective training and assessment. Yet despite the additional challenges posed by robotic surgery, no NTS rating systems have been developed for this unique surgical environment. This study reports the development and validation of the first NTS behavioural rating system for robotic surgery. Methods: A comprehensive index of all relevant NTS behaviours in robotic surgery was developed through observation of robotic theatre and interviews with robotic surgeons. Using a Delphi methodology, a panel of 16 expert surgeons was consulted to identify behaviours important to NTS assessment. These behaviours were organised into an appropriate assessment template. Experts were consulted on the feasibility, applicability and educational impact of ICARS. An observational trial was used to validate ICARS. 73 novice, intermediate and expert robotic surgeons completed a urethrovesical anastomosis within a simulated operating room. NTS were tested using four scripted scenarios of increasing difficulty. Performances were video recorded. Robotic and NTS experts assessed the videos post hoc using ICARS and the standard behavioural rating system, NOn-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS). Results: 28 key non-technical behaviours were identified by the expert panel. The finalised behavioural rating system was organised into four principle domains and seven categories. Expert opinion strongly supported its implementation. ICARS was found to be equivalent to NOTSS on Bland–Altman analysis and accurately differentiated between novice, intermediate and expert participants, p = 0.01. Moderate agreement was found between raters, Krippendorff’s alpha = 0.4. The internal structure of ICARS was shown to be consistent and reliable (median Cronbach alpha = 0.92, range 0.85–0.94). Conclusion: ICARS is the first NTS behavioural rating system developed for robotic surgery. Initial validation has shown it to be an effective and reliable tool.

We report results of the Delphi process to define and optimize robotic training procedures for HPB surgeons. Methods: In 2019, a robotic HPB surgery panel with an interest in surgical training from the Americas and Europe was created and met. An e-consensus–finding exercise using the Delphi process was applied and consensus was defined as 80% agreement on each question. Iterations of anonymous voting continued over three rounds. Results: Members agreed on several points: there was need for a standardized robotic training curriculum for HPB surgery that considers experience of surgeons and based on a robotic hepatectomy includes a common approach for “basic robotic skills” training (e-learning module, including hardware description, patient selection, port placement, docking, troubleshooting, fundamentals of robotic surgery, team training and efficiency, and emergencies) and an “advanced technical skills curriculum” (e-learning, including patient selection information, cognitive skills, and recommended operative equipment lists). A modular approach to index procedures should be used with video demonstrations, port placement for index procedure, troubleshooting, and emergency scenario management information. Inexperienced surgeons should undergo training in basic robotic skills and console proficiency, transitioning to full procedure training of e-learning (video demonstration, simulation training, case observation, and final evaluation). Experienced surgeons should undergo basic training when using a new system (e-learning, dry lab, and operating room (OR) team training, virtual reality modules, and wet lab; case observations were unnecessary for basic training) and should complete the advanced index procedural robotic curriculum with assessment by wet lab, case observation, and OR team training.

In 2015, approximately 650 000 robot-assisted procedures were performed worldwide. Surgeons must be properly trained to safely transition to using such innovative technology. Multiple virtual reality robotic simulators are now commercially available for educational and training purposes. There is a need for comparative evaluations of these simulators to aid users in selecting an appropriate device for their purposes. Methods: We conducted a comparison of the design and capabilities of all dedicated simulators of the da Vinci robot – the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS), dV-Trainer (dVT), Robotic Skills Simulators (RoSS) and the RobotiX Mentor. This paper provides the base specifications of the hardware and software, with an emphasis on the training capabilities of each system. Results: Each simulator contains a large number of training exercises for skills development: dVSS n = 40, dVT n = 65, RoSS n = 52, RobotiX Mentor n = 31. All four offer 3D visual images but use different display technologies. The dVSS leverages the real robotic surgical console to provide visualization, hand controls and foot pedals. The dVT, RoSS and RobotiX Mentor created simulated versions of all of these control systems. Each includes systems management services that allow instructors to collect, export and analyze the scores of students using the simulators. Conclusions: This study provides comparative information on the four simulators' functional capabilities. Each device offers unique advantages and capabilities for training robotic surgeons. Each has been the subject of validation experiments, which have been published in the literature. But those do not provide specific details on the capabilities of the simulators, which are necessary for an understanding sufficient to select the one best suited for an organization's needs.

Assessment tools include robotic simulator assessments and Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) metrics, which have been validated. Training programs use GEARS for proficiency testing; however, it requires a trained human evaluator. Due to limited time, learners are reliant on surgical simulator feedback to improve their skills. GEARS and simulator scores have been shown to be correlated but in what capacity is unknown. Our goal is to develop a model for predicting GEARS score using simulator metrics. Methods: Linear and multivariate logistic regressions were used on previously reported data by this group. Subjects performed simple (Ring and Rail 1) and complex (Suture Sponge 1) tasks on simulators, the dV-Trainer (dVT) and the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS). They were scored via simulator metrics and GEARS. Results: A linear model for each simulator and exercise showed a positive linear correlation. Equations were developed for predicting GEARS Total Score from simulator Overall Score. Next, the effects of each individual simulator metric on the GEARS Total Score for each simulator and exercise were examined. On the dVSS, Excessive Instrument Force was significant for Ring and Rail 1 and Instrument Collision was significant for Suture Sponge 1. On the dVT, Time to Complete was significant for both exercises. Once the significant variables were identified, multivariate models were generated. Comparing the predicted GEARS Total Score from the linear model (using only simulator Overall Score) to that using the multivariate model (using the significant variables for each simulator and exercise), the results were similar. Conclusions: Our results suggest that trainees can use simulator Overall Score to predict GEARS Total Score using our linear regression equations. This can improve the training process for those preparing for high-stakes assessments.",Assessment | Predictive model | Robotic simulator | Simulation | Surgical education,12,0,Not relevant

Several simulators have been introduced to support these aims—the daVinci skills simulator, Mimic dV-Trainer, Surgical Simulated Systems’ RoSS, and Simbionix Robotix Mentor. While multiple studies have been conducted to demonstrate the validity of these systems, studies comparing the perceived value of these devices as tools for education and skills are lacking. Methods: Subjects who qualified as medical students or physicians (n = 105) were assigned a specific order to use each of the three simulators. After completing a demographic questionnaire, participants performed one exercise on the three simulators and completed a second questionnaire regarding their experience with the device. After using all systems, they completed a final questionnaire, which detailed their comparative preferences. The subject’s performance metrics were also collected from each simulator. Results: The data confirmed the face, content, and construct validity for the dV-trainer and skills simulator.

However, laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has advanced slowly due to the significant learning curve (LC), and only few publications have dealt with advanced training in LLR. Methods: Two reviewers conducted systematic research through MEDLINE and EMBASE with combinations of the following keywords: (learning curve OR teaching OR training OR simulation OR education) AND (liver OR hepatic) AND (laparoscopic OR laparoscopy). Robotic-assisted, hand-assisted and hybrid LLRs were excluded. Results: Nineteen studies were retrieved. Overall, the level of evidence was low. Thirteen articles assessed the LC during real-life LLR, and six articles focussed on simulation and training programmes in LLR. The LC in minor LLR comprised 60 cases overall, and 15 cases for standardised left lateral sectionectomy. For major LLR (MLLR), the LC was 50 cases for most studies, but was reported to be 15–20 cases in more recent studies, provided MLLR is performed progressively in selected patients. However, there was heterogeneity in the literature regarding the number of minor LLRs required before MLLR, with 60 minor LLRs reported as the minimum. Six studies showed a potential benefit of simulation and training programmes in this field. The gradual implementation of LLR combined with simulation-based training programmes could reduce the clinical impact of LC. Conclusions: The LC in LLR is a long process, and MLLR should be gradually implemented under the supervision of experienced surgeons. Training outside the operating room may reduce the LC in real-life situations.",,20,0,Not relevant

Despite the tremendous increase in utilization, there are currently no validated curricula to train residents in robotic surgery, and the effects of robotic surgery on general surgery residency training are not well defined. In this study, we aim to explore the perceptions of resident and attending surgeons toward robotic surgery education in general surgery residency training. Methods: We performed a qualitative thematic analysis of in-person, one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with general surgery residents and attending surgeons at a large academic health system. Convenient and purposeful sampling was performed in order to ensure diverse demographics, experiences, and opinions were represented. Data were analyzed continuously, and interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached, which occurred after 20 residents and seven attendings. Results: All interviewees agreed that dual consoles are necessary to maximize the teaching potential of the robotic platform, and the importance of simulation and simulators in robotic surgery education is paramount. However, further work to ensure proper access to simulation resources for residents is necessary. While most recognize that bedside-assist skills are essential, most think its educational value plateaus quickly. Lastly, residents believe that earlier exposure to robotic surgery is necessary and that almost every case has a portion that is level-appropriate for residents to perform on the robot. Conclusions: As robotic surgery transitions from novelty to ubiquity, the importance of effective general surgery robotic surgery training during residency is paramount. Through in-depth interviews, this study provides examples of effective educational tools and techniques, highlights the importance of simulation, and explores opinions regarding the role of the resident in robotic surgery education.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify evidence on transferability of surgical skills acquired on robotic VR simulators to the operating room and the predictive value of robotic VR simulator performance for intraoperative performance. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched systematically. Risk of bias was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for Education. Correlation coefficients were chosen as effect measure and pooled using the inverse-variance weighting approach. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the summary effect. RESULTS: A total of 14 131 potential articles were identified; there were eight studies eligible for qualitative and three for quantitative analysis. Three of four studies demonstrated transfer of surgical skills from robotic VR simulators to the operating room measured by time and technical surgical performance. Two of three studies found significant positive correlations between robotic VR simulator performance and intraoperative technical surgical performance; quantitative analysis revealed a positive combined correlation (r = 0.67, 95 per cent c.i. 0.22 to 0.88).

The task used in this study was the Tube 2 and it imitates a vesicourethral anastomosis in robotic prostatectomy. The effects were analyzed by the time to end the task after overcoming the learning curve which is determined by several performance parameters. Results: The number of task repetitions required to reach the learning curve plateau was 45, 42, and 37 repetitions in groups I, II, and III, which means that there was continuous improvement in performing the task after 40 repetitions only in groups I and II. The mean time for completing the task during the stabilization period was significantly different between group I and group III and group II and group III, which means that the independent training method was inferior to the other methods (group I vs. group II vs. group III: 187.38 vs. 187.07 vs. 253.47 seconds, P < .001).

However, gaps exist in understanding and adapting to the impact of these changing demographics. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a national survey to analyze demographics, gender-based professional difference, needs in terms of catheterization laboratory (Cath-Lab) abstention, and radiation safety issues in Italian Cath-Lab settings. A survey supported by the Italian Society of Interventional Cardiology (Società Italiana di Cardiologia Interventistica–Gruppo Italiano di Studi Emodinamici SICI-GISE) was mailed to all SICI-GISE members. Categorical data were compared using the χ2 test. P<0.05 was considered significant. There were 326 respondents: 20.2% were <35 years old, and 64.4% had >10 years of Cath-Lab experience. Notably, 26.4% were women. Workload was not gender-influenced (women performed “on-call” duty 69.8% versus men 68.3%; P=0.97). Women were more frequently unmarried (22.1% women versus 8.7% men; P=0.002) and childless (43.9% versus 56.1%; P<0.001). Interestingly, 69.8% of women versus 44.6% of men (P<0.001) argued that preg-nancy/breastfeeding negatively impacts professional skill development and career advancement. For Cath-Lab abstention, 38.9% and 69.6% of respondents considered it useful to perform percutaneous coronary intervention robotic simulations and ""refresh-skill"" sessions while they were absent or on return to work, respectively, without gender differences. Overall, 80% of respondents described current radioprotection counseling efforts as inadequate and not gender specific. Finally, 26.7% faced some type of job discrimination, a significantly higher proportion of whom were women. CONCLUSIONS: Several gender-based differences exist or are perceived to exist among interventional cardiologists in Italian Cath-Labs. Joint strategies addressing Cath-Lab abstention and radiation exposure education should be developed to pro-mote gender equity in interventional cardiologists.",Catheterization laboratory | Ethics | Gender | Pregnancy | Radiation safety | Women,1,1,Not relevant

Robotic surgical skills are unique from those used in either open or laparoscopic surgery. The acquisition of a basic robotic surgical skill set may be best accomplished in the simulation laboratory. We sought to review the current literature pertaining to the use of virtual reality (VR) simulation in the acquisition of robotic surgical skills on the da Vinci Surgical System. Materials and methods: A PubMed search was conducted between December 2014 and January 2015 utilizing the following keywords: virtual reality, robotic surgery, da Vinci, da Vinci skills simulator, SimSurgery Educational Platform, Mimic dV-Trainer, and Robotic Surgery Simulator. Articles were included if they were published between 2007 and 2015, utilized VR simulation for the da Vinci Surgical System, and utilized a commercially available VR platform. Results: The initial search criteria returned 227 published articles. After all inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 47 peer-reviewed manuscripts were included in the final review. Conclusions: There are many benefits to utilizing VR simulation for robotic skills acquisition. Four commercially available simulators have been demonstrated to be capable of assessing robotic skill. Three of the four simulators demonstrate the ability of a VR training curriculum to improve basic robotic skills, with proficiency-based training being the most effective training style. The skills obtained on a VR training curriculum are comparable with those obtained on dry laboratory simulation.

They consist of an end effector and a base, which connected by several cables. CDPRs have a large workspace compared to the workspace of classic parallel robots. CDPR have a simpler structure have good dynamic properties, high carrying capacity, mobility and low cost. The only drawback is that the CDPR cables can only work for retraction and cannot push. This article presents the design of a prototype of a planar CDPR with four cables for practical use in the educational process. This prototype of a planar CDPR is necessary for a better understanding of the design features, structure, kinematics, statics and dynamics of the CDPR by students. The planar CDPR performs two translational motions, due to the controlled 4 cables, and one rotational motion of the end effector. The research of the kinematics and statics of the planar cable-driven parallel robot is carried out. Simulation of the motion of a planar cable-driven parallel robot in the Python programming language has been carried out. A design was developed and a prototype of the planar cable-driven parallel robot was manufactured. Experimental researches of a prototype of the planar cable-driven parallel robot have been carried out. The results of experimental researches have shown that the CDPR works well enough. During the tests of the prototype of the planar cable-driven parallel robot, it was found that the distortions of the trajectory of the end effector depend on the tension of the cables. It is necessary to monitor the tension level using strain gauges. Based on the analysis of the results obtained, the effectiveness of the use of the prototype of a planar CDPR in the educational process of the robotics course has been confirmed",cable-driven parallel robot | control | design | encoder | end effector | kinematics | planar | prototype | statics | tension,0,1,Not relevant

Objective To identify training methods available for robot-assisted surgical (RAS) training in urology, evaluate their effectiveness in terms of validation, educational impact, acceptability, and cost effectiveness, and assess their effect on learning curves (LCs). Evidence acquisition A systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines searched Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Results were screened to include appropriate studies. Quality was evaluated. Each method was evaluated, and conclusions were drawn regarding LCs. Evidence synthesis Of 359 records, 24 were included (521 participants). Training methods included dry-lab training (n = 7), wet-lab training (n = 7), mentored training (n = 7), and nonstructured pathways (n = 5). Dry-lab training demonstrated educational impact by reducing console time and was acceptable in a study; 100% of participants confirmed face validity. Wet-lab training principally uses human cadaveric material; effectiveness is well rated, although dry-lab training and observation were rated as equally useful. Mentored programmes combine lectures, tutorials, observation, simulation, and proctoring. Minifellowships were linked to greater practice of RAS 1 yr later. LCs vary according to experience. One study found that surgeons from robot-related fellowships demonstrated fewer positive surgical margins than surgeons from laparoscopic-related fellowships (24% vs 34.6%; p = 0.05) and reduced time (132 vs 152 min; p = 0.0003). Five studies examined nonstructured training pathways (clinical practice). Experience correlated with fewer complications (p = 0.007), improved continence (p = 0.049), and reduced time (p = 0.002). Conclusions RAS training methods include dry and wet lab, mentored training, and nonstructured pathways. Limited available evidence suggests that they affect LCs differently and are rarely used alone. The different methods of training appear effective when combined.

N.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,Book Series,"Control approaches for the most modern exoskeleton devices are based on the use of the potentiometric proportional sensors. This allows setting the velocity of the movement of the exoskeleton links, but has significant peculiarities, which are concluded in a large time delay for processing the control signal and increased sensitivity of such sensors, which leads to increased injury risk during control. The use of muscle biopotentials for control of an exoskeleton device also makes it possible to take into account the physiological characteristics of the operator for using the exoskeleton in various areas of human activity. The development of control algorithms of the exoskeleton, along with the use of the activity of human muscle groups’ data, is essential for expanding the functionality of a human-machine system such as the “operator-exoskeleton”. The paper considers the interaction of a human and an exoskeleton drive based on mathematical models of a DC motor with a current feedback loop and a muscle duplex. A calibration algorithm is proposed to determine the parameters of the muscle duplex model in order to form a database that corresponds to an individual operator and reflects its individual characteristics. The technique for setting the parameters of the control system in the exoskeleton calibration mode is given.

,,Work in Progress: Experiential modules using Texas instruments robotic system learning kit (TI RSLK) for teaching control systems,cp,"University of California, Davis",Davis,United States,"Ouyang, Jun;Rashtian, Hooman","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"Control Systems is usually a senior-level class in Electrical Engineering which serves as the opening gate towards important engineering fields such as robotics. Students usually take this class while they are excited to learn about practical control systems. However, the course content is traditionally composed of theoretical concepts such as steady-state error, transient response, stability analysis, root-locus techniques, frequency-response techniques (Nyquist and Bode) and controller design which require advanced mathematical background and skills. While in the beginning of the course, most instructors spend a few lectures on modelling of electrical, mechanical and electromechanical systems, students mainly work with block diagrams and transfer functions of such systems for the remainder of the course. This oftentimes results in students losing the connection between the theories covered in the course and their practical applications to the point that some of them find the course as too abstract. There are a considerable number of works published in engineering education literature which have tried to bridge the gap between theory and practical applications. However, many of the proposed solutions require special equipment which are costly and thus limit students' exposure to hands-on experiences to laboratory sessions when they have access to the lab equipment and kits. For example, Birdsong has developed a set of experiments based on a robotic arm in [1]. However, the robotic arm is costly and may require students to share its usage. As another example, the work in [2] utilizes LEGO Mindstorm robots which again is a costly solution. In our institution, while Control Systems is listed as a lab course, the lab component of the course consisted of MATLAB and Simulink assignments on designing various controllers such as lead-lag and PID controllers. While MATLAB is a very strong tool in teaching control theory and is widely used by numerous instructors, it does not provide the hands-on experience needed to inspire students to learn control theory. To address this problem and to give students the opportunity of having hands-on experiences outside lecture and lab time, a new set of experiential modules using the Texas Instruments Robotic System Learning Kit (TI RSLK) are developed in this work. The main advantage of this approach comparing to other proposed lab experiments is that RSLK is an affordable kit that students can purchase and modify at will. By working on the developed experiential modules, students solve a real controller design problem using hand analysis followed by MATLAB and Simulink simulations and finally RSLK implementation and measurement to confirm if the design specifications are met. These experiential modules include finding the approximate transfer function of TI RSLK using MATLAB System Identification Toolbox, designing a Proportional (P) controller for RSLK, and finally designing a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to fulfill a zero steady-state error for ramp inputs. Another feature of the developed labs is that unlike many of other reported works (e.g. [3-8]), the designed controllers in these experiential modules are implemented at the circuit-level using analog op-amp circuits and this in turn provides an opportunity to teach control theory to students who do not have an advanced background in microcontroller programming.",,1,0,Not relevant

In the building energy analysis domain, several tools have been created in the past to facilitate such analyses. However, the existing coupling frameworks such as Building Control Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB), MLE+, High-Level Architecture (HLA), and Functional Mockup Unit are characterized by their inherent complexity, making it a challenge for the building practitioners to widely deploy them in everyday decision-making. In addition, several of these frameworks embody tight coupling, which means they lack the flexibility to incorporate models and components of decision-makers’ choice. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a Lightweight and Adaptive Building Simulation (LABS) framework that capitalizes on Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM), an inter-process communication framework widely used by the robotics community. As a case study demonstrating this new framework, a building energy simulation model is coupled with an agent-based occupant behavior model to understand the energy effects of occupants’ thermal comfort related actions (e.g., adjusting the thermostat set point). These behavioral patterns are also influenced by various interventions (e.g., peer pressure, energy-based education) that may occur in the building. Measuring these effects in a real building for a lengthy period is impractical and resource-intensive and the LABS framework can be used for understanding this system better. The results also highlight opportunities for achieving energy savings by influencing the occupants’ comfort related behavior.",distributed simulation | energy simulation | lightweight and adaptive building simulation | occupant behavior model | thermal comfort,8,0,Not relevant

With the adaptation of technology in dentistry, pre-clinical training has now employed simulation. It provides the opportunity for students to develop psychomotor skills for procedures by practising pre-clinical, standardised learning competencies before they engage in patientmanagement. Simulation involves computer-aided learning, augmented reality and virtual reality, which are largely taking over pre-clinical teaching. Augmented reality is commonly being employed in maxillofacial, restorative, tooth morphology learning and mastering technique for administering local anaesthesia in dentistry. Virtual reality is being employed particularly in pre-treatment implant planning and dental education for students. Use of haptic technology, like robotics, is also gaining popularity, and facilitates a two-way communication between the user and the environment to better simulate the clinical setting for learning purposes.",Augmented reality | Dental education | Virtual reality,3,0,Not relevant

Detroit Mercy engineering students take a comprehensive physics sequence during the winter semester of their freshman year and fall semester of their sophomore year. The college offers PHY 3690 Modern Physics with Device Applications as a junior level physics course. The course is required of electrical engineers and offered as an elective to other engineering students. The class covers introductory topics in quantum mechanics leading to a basic understanding of the behavior of charge carriers in solids. A description of the course and the students will be presented later in the paper. Students are introduced to entanglement and quantum computation with computer simulations of quantum measurements. We believe that a brief introduction to these topics helps students understand the relationship between operators and the results of a measurement of the wavefunction. Over the past several years we have assessed students in the course with the Quantum Mechanics Conceptual Survey (QMCS).[1] This instrument was designed to be used as a general survey of students' conceptual understanding. One of the interesting aspects of this instrument is that engineering students in modern physics courses were considered during its development and validation. In this paper we will analyze our students' conceptual understanding of quantum mechanical concepts and compare them with those students that participated in the development of the survey. Responses to sample questions will be examined and student difficulties will be identified.

The topic not only addresses data preparation, real-time data processing, big data analytics, visualization and machine interface design but also cyber security and safety. Especially, unauthorized access to protected (personal or enterprise) data or unauthorized control of production facilities imply risks when it comes to digitalization. Because of the increased complexity of state-of-the-art technologies, educational institutions need to provide practice-oriented teaching methods in learning factories to help engineers of today understand the impact of those developments. In the light of this fact, this paper presents a practical approach of teaching digitalization strategies in CPPS.

Level 3 automated driving systems are expected to increase safety, comfort and traffic efficiency. For the human driver, these functions and according human-machine interfaces are a novel technology. In the human factors domain, research and development faces two challenges which are (1) the conceptualization of intuitive and easy to use interfaces and (2) the development of a methodological framework to evaluate these interfaces. In technology evaluation, a methodological phenomenon has frequently been reported which is called the preference-performance dissociation. It describes the outcome of studies where users’ preference (i.e., self-report) does not match their performance (i.e., interaction behavior). This phenomenon poses a threat to the evaluation of automated vehicle HMIs. Therefore, this chapter first reports a review and discussion of studies that investigated the operationalization of both measures. Moreover, the understanding (i.e., mental model) of automated vehicle HMIs is an influential precursor of performance and included in the present work. Using the insights of the operationalization part, the second part of this work aimed at finding out about factors that exert influence on preference and/or performance. Investigated factors were the number of use case repetitions, feedback on operator performance, user education and a post-hoc statistical analysis. To reach the operationalization and variation aims, three driving simulator studies with a total of N = 225 participants were conducted. The main outcomes were that (1) a sophisticated recommendation regarding preference questionnaire application is presented. Furthermore, (2) insights into the development of behavioral measures over time and their relation to a satisfaction measure could be given. Concerning mental models, (3) the present work showed that it takes repeated interaction to evolve accurately and gaze measures could also be used for capturing these processes. In addition, (4) feedback on operator performance was found to influence preference but not performance while (5) user education increased understanding and subsequent performance but did not affect preference. Eventually it showed that (6) users of different performance levels report similar preference. The theoretical contribution of this work lies in insights into the formation of the two sources of data and its potential to both explain and predict the preference-performance dissociation. The practical contribution lies in the recommendation for research methodology regarding how to operationalize measures and how to design user studies concerning the number of use cases and user education approaches. Finally, the results gained herein do not only apply to automated vehicle HMIs but might also be generalized to related domains such as aviation, robotics or health care.",Adaptive Cruise Control | Human-Computer Interaction | Human-Machine Interface | Operational Design Domain | System Usability Scale,0,0,Not relevant

Incentivized by work hour restrictions, patient safety initiatives, and inspired by technical advances in biomaterials and rapid printing strategies, this emerging, and fascinating area of research has begun to make headway into clinical practice. However, concerns about cost, limited understanding of the technical processes involved, and lack of its potential uses remain barriers to its widespread adoption. We examined existing published literature on how 3D printing technologies have been utilized in the field of Urology to enhance pre-operative planning, revitalize surgical training, and modernize patient education, with particular focus on, robotic surgery. To date, 3D-printed models have been used and studied most commonly in the preoperative planning for nephron-sparing surgeries during the treatment of renal masses, where the challenges of complex renal anatomy and benefits of reducing renal ischemic injury create the most intuitive value. Prostate models are the second most common, particularly in the planning of nerve-sparing procedures. Early studies have demonstrated sufficient realism and educational effectiveness. Subsequent studies demonstrated improved surgeon confidence, operative performance, and optimized patient outcomes including high levels of patient satisfaction. Realistic, accurate, and reasonably priced models can currently be generated within hours using standard desktop 3D printers. While primarily utilized as anatomic replicas of diseased organs that restore a sense of haptic feedback lost in robotic procedures, innovations in polymers, improvements in 3D printer host and modeling software, and upgrades in printer hardware allow this technology to serve as a comprehensive, interactive, simulation platform that can be a critical surgical decision making as well as an effective teaching tool.

Inspired by the finding that the wavelet coefficient distribution of the clean spectrum is sparser than that of the degraded spectrum, a blind reconstruction model for infrared spectrum is proposed in this paper to regularize the distribution of the degraded spectrum by total variation regularization. This method outperforms when suppressing random noise and preserving the spectral structure details. In addition, an effective optimization scheme is introduced in overcoming the issue of formulated optimization. The instrument response function and latent spectrum can be simultaneously estimated through the proposed method that can efficiently mitigate the effects caused by instrument degradation.

Recent studies suggest that robots currently being used in education are social robots where most of them don't write directly as the way humans do by holding a pen and moving it over a paper, besides, use an indirect medium such as touch screen as the shared environment which creates a noticeable barrier in natural interaction. In this work, we develop a new robot named Kiddo that sits on a desk, has an animatronic face, can write with a whiteboard marker, and provides a shared environment where the robot and a child can write simultaneously. The robot learns to write shapes by maneuvering its hand just like we humans do which creates a vivid image to the child interacting with it. We have used CNN based model to recognize and draw 100 shapes collected from the National Curriculum Bengali, English, and Mathematics textbook of Bangladesh. To learn new shapes from children's demonstration an artificial intelligence system was build which can generate path trajectories from a camera image. We experimented with three kids where they drew 18 known and 4 new shapes on the shared whiteboard and Kiddo was also able to recognize and draw 17 of the known shapes and learn to draw all the new shapes from the children's demonstration in both simulation and in real.",artificial intelligence | Educational robot | human robot interaction | robot writing,2,0,Not relevant

Surgical education through simulations started around 2,500 years ago when they were first used in the planning of unique and innovative surgeries while ensuring the safety of the subjects. Currently, simulations include animal models, cadaveric models, benchtop models and complex robotic models. In a programme involving surgical simulators, four requirements are followed to optimise their effectiveness, including mandatory involvement, skill-based instruction, standardised training plan, and overtraining. We can make a reasonable estimation that the future is technology-based. The speed with which we anticipate the fusion of these virtual reality and robotics-based simulation technology with medical educations and practices largely depends on the affordability and economics of these tools.

The goal of such simulation programs is both for training and study of the human behavior of astronauts in space simulated environments. The virtual multi-user experience consists of the virtual simulation of the experience made by more users during the interaction between each other and also with the surrounding environment. In specific, in the Space sector, the virtual multi-user experience can be applied to simulate concurrent activities of astronauts interacting with the simulated space environment already at the start of the project, with a low budget and e effort. Possible examples of application are in the simulation and training of exploration, maintenance and inspection, communication with ground/Space station, tasks execution for command and control of robotics systems, and most important also into safety analysis and risk preventions.

The aim of this study was to evaluate workload levels of urology residents when performing a live porcine nephrectomy and the virtual reality robotic surgery training modules employed during this workshop. Twenty-one residents from 14 SES AUA programs participated in 2015. On the first-day residents were taught with didactic lectures by faculty. On the second day, trainees were divided into two groups. Half were asked to perform training modules of the Mimic da Vinci-Trainer (MdVT, Mimic Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) for 4 h, while the other half performed nephrectomy procedures on a live porcine model using the da Vinci Si robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

All trainees were asked to complete the NASA-TLX 1-page questionnaire following both the MdVT simulation and live animal model sessions. A significant interface and TLX interaction was observed. The interface by TLX interaction was further analyzed to determine whether the scores of each of the six TLX scales varied across the two interfaces. The means of the TLX scores observed at the two interfaces were similar. The only significant difference was observed for frustration, which was significantly higher at the simulation than the animal model, t (20) = 4.12, p = 0.001. This could be due to trainees’ familiarity with live anatomical structures over skill set simulations which remain a real challenge to novice surgeons. Another reason might be that the simulator provides performance metrics for specific performance traits as well as composite scores for entire exercises. Novice trainees experienced substantial mental workload while performing tasks on both the simulator and the live animal model during the robotics course. The NASA-TLX profiles demonstrated that the live animal model and the MdVT were similar in difficulty, as indicated by their comparable workload profiles.",Mental workload | NASA Task Load Index | Robotic surgery training,12,0,Not relevant

In this study, we model SNSs in a classroom and apply multi-agent simulation to analyze the influence of SNSs on classroom friendships. We focus on junior high school students as our research object. In the proposed model, which is based on socion theory, an agent can communicate with other agents using two types of networks: a classroom network and SNS networks, via a network which recognized by each individual (in socion theory, people have mental networks that reflect society). Agents communicate face to face (FTF) in the classroom and using SNS in their SNS groups. In addition, agents have social skills and are categorized based on these social skills. In this study, we simulate friendship relations considering SNSs and discuss the influence of SNSs on classroom relationships based on the simulation results. We performed two simulations; one only involved FTF communication and the others involved both FTF and SNS communication. We compare the two simulations and discuss the results. We found that, compared to FTF communication, the average likability rating of agents increased with SNS communication. On the other hand, we also found that specific agents were rejected.

This workshop was organized by faculty at several universities with financial support from industry partners and the National Science Foundation. The purpose of the workshops was to create a cohesive effort among mechatronics and robotics courses, minors and degree programs. Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering (MRE) is an integration of mechanics, controls, electronics, and software, which provides a unique opportunity for engineering students to function on multidisciplinary teams. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, it attracts diverse and innovative students, and graduates better-prepared professional engineers. In this fast growing field, there is a great need to standardize educational material and make MRE education more widely available and easier to adopt. This can only be accomplished if the community comes together to speak with one clear voice about not only the benefits, but also the best ways to teach it. These efforts would also aid in establishing more of these degree programs and integrating minors or majors into existing computer science, mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering departments. The final workshop was attended by approximately 50 practitioners from industry and academia. Participants identified many practical skills required for students to succeed in an MRE curriculum and as practicing engineers after graduation. These skills were then organized into the following categories: professional, independent learning, controller design, numerical simulation and analysis, electronics, software development, and system design. For example, professional skills include technical reports, presentations, and documentation. Independent learning includes reading data sheets, performing internet searches, doing a literature review, and having a maker mindset. Numerical simulation skills include understanding data, presenting data graphically, solving and simulating in software such as MATLAB, Simulink and Excel. Controller design involves selecting a controller, tuning a controller, designing to meet specifications, and understanding when the results are good enough. Electronics skills include selecting sensors, interfacing sensors, interfacing actuators, creating printed circuit boards, wiring on a breadboard, soldering, installing drivers, using integrated circuits, and using microcontrollers. Software development of embedded systems includes agile program design, state machines, analyzing and evaluating code results, commenting code, troubleshooting, debugging, AI and machine learning. Finally, system design includes prototyping, creating CAD models, design for manufacturing, breaking a system down into subsystems, integrating and interfacing subcomponents, having a multidisciplinary perspective, robustness, evaluating tradeoffs, testing, validation, and verification, failure, effect, and mode analysis. A survey was prepared and sent out to the participants from all four workshops as well as other robotics faculty, researchers and industry personnel in order to elicit a broader community response. Because one of the biggest challenges in mechatronics and robotics education is the absence of standardized curricula, textbooks, platforms, syllabi, assignments, and learning outcomes, this was a vital part of the process to achieve some level of consensus. This paper presents an introduction to MRE education, related work on existing programs, methods, results of the practical skills survey, and then draws conclusions based upon these results. It aims to create the foundation for standardizing the development of student skills in mechatronics and robotics curricula across institutions, disciplines, majors and minors. The survey was completed by 94 participants and it was clear that there is a consensus that the primary skills students should have upon completion of MRE courses or a program is a broader multidisciplinary systems-level perspective, an ability to problem solve, and an ability to design a system to meet specifications.",Curriculum | Mechatronics | Robotics | Skills,2,0,Not relevant

They assess whether Sachs' et al. (2015) negative long run welfare consequences of digitalization also arise when the government as an agent of young households invests in human capital with the aim to counteract the decrease in labor productivity resulting from the substitution of robots for traditional capital. They also question whether robots raise or diminish existing unemployment. Next, the book explores how ""brain drain"" affects human capital development and utilization with its consequences on the development of West Africa, using descriptive information along with a review of relevant literature. The authors examine the link between human capital development and substance use from the perspective of adolescence into adulthood. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications for extending research on this particular population are also addressed. Following this, the book discusses a scientific analysis with qualitative and quantitative results that demonstrate the relevance of the organizational and administrative behavior that makes it possible to develop productive human capital in different settings, including within families. The authors present findings on the Theory of Vacuum which allows for the performing of deep analysis of vacuums' structure and determining their previously unstudied aspects. This work offers and verifies a hypothesis on the existence of vacuums in human capital, with the goal of studying the structure of human capital from the position of the Theory of Vacuum. Following this, the work provides an overview of a human capital theory based on increasing rates of return to education. This theory explains their relative historical growth path divergence and simulations that predict their future income per capita convergence. The authors also analyze how High-performance Work Systems could create human capital that efficiently develops organizational processes and increases company performance, thus making it easier to understand how Human Resource Management practices could enhance organizational performance.

As being one of the pillars of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, DT-s are widely integrated into the existing factories, enhancing the concept of the virtual factories. View from the research perspective is that experiments on the Internet of Things, data acquisition, cybersecurity, telemetry synchronization with physical factories, etc. are being executed in those virtual simulations. Moreover, new ways of interactions and interface to oversee, interact and learn are being developed via the assistance of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, which are already widely spread on the consumer market. However, already, VR is being used widely in existing commercial software packages and toolboxes to provide students, teachers, operators, engineers, production managers, and researchers with an immersive way of interacting with the factory while the manufacturing simulation is running. This gives a better understanding and more in-depth knowledge of the actual manufacturing processes, not being directly accessing those. However, the virtual presence mentioned above experience is limited to a single person. It does not enable additional functionalities for the simulations, which can be re-planning or even re-programming of the physical factory in an online connection by using VR or AR interfaces. The main aim of the related research paper is to enhance already existing fully synchronized with physical world DT-s with multi-user experience, enabling factory operators to work with and reprogram the real machinery from remote locations in a more intuitive way instead thinking about final aim than about the process itself.

In 2014, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education published the Pediatric Urology Milestone Project as a metric of fellow proficiency in multiple facets of training, including laparoscopic/robotic procedures. Objective The present study assessed trends in minimally invasive surgery training and utilization of the Milestones among recent Pediatric Urology fellows. Study design Using an electronic survey instrument, Pediatric Urology fellowship program directors and fellows who completed their clinical year in 2015 were surveyed. Participants were queried regarding familiarity with the Milestone Project, utilization of the Milestones, robotic/laparoscopic case volume and training experience, and perceived competency with robotic/laparoscopic surgery at the start and end of the fellowship clinical year according to Milestone criteria. Responses were accepted between August and November 2015. Results Surveys were distributed via e-mail to 35 fellows and 30 program directors. Sixteen fellows (46%) and 14 (47%) program directors responded. All fellows reported some robotic experience prior to fellowship, and 69% performed >50 robotic/laparoscopic surgeries during residency. Fellow robotic/laparoscopic case volume varied: three had 1–10 cases (19%), four had 11–20 cases (25%), and nine had >20 cases (56%). Supplementary or robotic training modalities included simulation (9), animal models (6), surgical videos (7), and courses (2). Comparison of beginning and end of fellowship robotic/laparoscopic Milestone assessment (Summary Fig.) revealed scores of <3 in (10) 62% of fellow self-assessments and 10 (75%) of program director assessments. End of training Milestone scores >4 were seen in 12 (75%) of fellow self-assessment and eight (57%) of program director assessments. Discussion An improvement in robotic/laparoscopic Milestone scores by both fellow self-assessment and program director assessment was observed during the course of training; however, 43% of program directors rated their fellow below the graduation target of a Milestone score of 4.

Five years ago, we identified trends in the use of robotic and laparoscopic simulation in 2008 and 2009 at American urology residency training programs. We seek to identify the changes in the use of simulators and the presence of formal curricula in the wake of technological advances and changes in graduate medical education. Methods: Attendees of the American Urological Association (AUA) Basic Sciences Course, mostly in their second or third year of residency, were surveyed on the availability and use of laparoscopic/robotic simulators at their program, the presence of a formal curriculum, and a Likert scale questionnaire regarding face and content validity. Results: Over a 5-year period, the availability of virtual reality robotic simulators substantially increased from 14% to nearly 60% availability in 2013. Despite this increase, the frequency of simulator use remained unchanged (p = 0.40) and the reported presence of formal curricula decreased from 41% to 34.8%. There was no significant difference in simulator use between residents in programs with or without laparoscopic/robotic curricula (p = 0.95). There was also a decrease in the percentage of residents who felt official laparoscopic curricula (93%-81%) and simulators (82%-74%) should be involved in resident education. Conclusions: In the past 5 years, despite evidence supporting benefits from simulator use and increasing availability, self-reported resident use has remained unchanged and the reporting of presence of laparoscopic/robotic curricula has decreased. With more dedicated investment in formal curricula, residency training programs may receive greater returns on their simulator investments, improve resident skills and comfort, and ultimately improve the quality of patient care.",,14,0,Not relevant

Factors impacting trainee independence include the restriction of clinical work hours and the development of advanced minimally invasive techniques such as robotics, which requires separate technical education outside of conventional surgical education. Moreover, when residents are left to learn fundamental exposures via their clinical experience alone, they run the risk of not being exposed to some fundamental skills based on case volume and type. The Department of Surgery at Emory University developed a cadaver-based simulation curriculum to standardize exposure to fundamental operative skills and enhance proficiency outside the operating room, with the larger aim of improving resident autonomy. Methods: Residents were assigned to small groups led by a chief resident with an even distribution of postgraduate year (PGY) levels. Each group participated in core surgical exposures and fundamental maneuvers on a cadaver over a 6-hour session. Residents were tested on skills according to their PGY level about 1 month after the course. Testing included recitation of the skill in an oral boards format, highlighting major steps, followed by performance of the skill. All steps were video-recorded with no resident identifiers. These were reviewed by 2 independent, blinded faculty examiners who assigned proficiency grades to each resident video. Results: Three hundred and thirty-three individual procedure evaluations were done over the 5-year period. Senior residents (PGY3-5) had 86% pass rate while junior residents (PGY1-2) had 70% pass rate. Overall, 21% of residents failed to achieve competence in their assigned skills. Junior residents were less likely to achieve competence compared to senior residents. Faculty graders had improved congruence in grading as the course progressed through the 5 years. The most recent 2 years had >80% congruence in faculty grading compared to less than 50% congruence in the first 2 years. 81% of attendings agreed this course positively influenced the granting of autonomy in the operating room. Conclusions: A cadaveric skills course focused on fundamental maneuvers with objective confirmation of achieving competency is a viable adjunct to clinical operative experience.

Surgical skills are usually assessed by questionnaires completed by an expert observer. With the advent of surgical robots, automated surgical performance metrics (APMs)—objective measures related to instrument movements—can be computed. The aim of this systematic review was thus to assess APMs use in robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures. The primary outcome was the assessment of surgical skills by APMs and the secondary outcomes were the association between APM and surgeon parameters and the prediction of clinical outcomes. Methods: A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted. PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were screened with the query “robot-assisted surgery OR robotic surgery AND performance metrics” between January 2010 and January 2021. The quality of the studies was assessed by the medical education research study quality instrument. The study settings, metrics, and applications were analysed. Results: The initial search yielded 341 citations of which 16 studies were finally included. The study settings were either simulated virtual reality (VR) (4 studies) or real clinical environment (12 studies). Data to compute APMs were kinematics (motion tracking), and system and specific events data (actions from the robot console). APMs were used to differentiate expertise levels, and thus validate VR modules, predict outcomes, and integrate datasets for automatic recognition models. APMs were correlated with clinical outcomes for some studies. Conclusions: APMs constitute an objective approach for assessing technical skills. Evidence of associations between APMs and clinical outcomes remain to be confirmed by further studies, particularly, for non-urological procedures.

Based on the BPR a 1-day robotic surgery training was organised to answer the following research questions: (1) Are novice robot surgeons able to accurately self-assess their knowledge and dexterity skills? (2) Is it possible to include the teaching of all BPRs in a 1-day training? Materials and methods: Based on the BPR, a robot surgery course was developed for residents and specialists (surgery, gynaecology and urology). In preparation, the participants completed an online e-module. The 1-day training consisted of a practical part on robot set-up, a theoretical section, and hands-on exercises on virtual reality robot simulators. Multiple online questionnaire was filled out by the participants at the end of the training to evaluate the perceived educational value of the course and to self-assess the degree to which BPRs were reached. Results: 20 participants completed the training during the conference of the Dutch Association for Endoscopic Surgery (NVEC) in 2017. Participants indicated nearly all competency requirements were mastered at the end of the training. The competency requirements not mastered were, however, critical requirements for the safe use of the surgical robot. Skill simulation results show a majority of participants are unable to reach a proficient simulation score in basic skill simulation exercises. Conclusion: Results show novice robot surgeons are too positive in the self-assessment of their own dexterity skills after a 1-day training.

Aiming to allay surgeon concerns of intra-operative emergencies, an insitu simulation-based clinical system's test (SbCST) can be completed to test the current clinical system, and to practice low-frequency, high-stakes clinical scenarios with the entire operating room (OR) team. Methods: Six different OR teams completed an insitu SbCST of an intra-operative pulmonary artery injury during a robot-assisted thoracic surgery at a single tertiary care center. The OR team consisted of an attending thoracic surgeon, surgery resident, anesthesia attending, anesthesia resident, circulating nurse, and a scrub technician. This test was conducted with an entire OR team along with study observers and simulation center staff. Outcomes included the identified latent safety threats (LSTs) and possible solutions for each LST, culminating in a complete failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). A Risk Priority Number (RPN) was determined for each LST identified. Pre- and post-simulation surveys using Likert scales were also collected. Results: The six FMEAs identified 28 potential LSTs in four categories. Of these 28 LSTs, nine were considered high priority based on their Risk Priority Number (RPN) with seven of the nine being repeated multiple times. Pre- and post-simulation survey responses were similar, with the majority of participants (94%) agreeing that high fidelity simulation of intra-operative emergencies is helpful and provides an opportunity to train for high-stakes, low-frequency events. After completing the SbCST, more participants felt confident that they knew their role during an intra-operative emergency than their pre-simulation survey responses. All participants agreed that simulation is an important part of continuing education and is helpful for learning skills that are infrequently used. Following the SbCST, more participants agreed that they knew how to safely undock the da Vinci robot during an emergency. Conclusions: SbCSTs provide an opportunity to test the current clinical system with a low-frequency, high-stakes event and allow medical personnels to practice their skills and teamwork. By completing multiple SbCSTs, we were able to identify multiple LSTs within different OR teams, allowing for a broader review of the current clinical systems in place. The use of these SbCSTs in conjunction with debriefing sessions and FMEA completion allows for the most significant potential improvement of the current system.

The camera installed on the line following robot aims to detect image-based lines and to navigate the robot to follow the path. This paper proposed a method of image preprocessing along with its robot action for line-following robots. This includes image preprocessing such as dilation, erosion, Gaussian filtering, contour search, and centerline definition to detect path lines and to determine the proper robot action. The implementation of the robot is simulated using Webots simulator. OpenCV and Python are utilized to design line detection systems and robot movements. The simulation result shows that the method is implemented properly, and the robot can follow a different type of path lines such as zigzag, dotted, and curved line.

Community colleges are generally well-suited to the task of producing graduates with the necessary skill sets for entering the workforce and meeting this demand, but rural institutions face a major barrier in the form of insufficient resources to purchase equipment, hire qualified staff, and provide facilities to support multifarious academic and technical programs. Additional challenges such as a lack of enrollment, student demographic homogeneity, and geographic isolation also disproportionately impact rural higher education. Faced with these challenges in 2014, Bay de Noc Community College developed an innovative partnership with a regional university to leverage economies of scale through the sharing of talent, resources, and even students, in order to address local workforce needs in the area of Mechatronics and Robotics Systems. This partnership has resulted in a stackable degree program that provides students with multiple exit points, the development of non-credit workshops for other educational faculty and incumbent workers, and even the creation of robotic simulation software. Now, three years after the advent of this partnership, Bay de Noc Community College and Michigan Technological University are able to share their model of collaboration with other rural and urban communities to demonstrate how effective partnering between the two-year and four-year levels of higher education can alleviate many of the challenges that afflict community colleges, especially those from a rural environment. Co-developing curriculum, working with the same equipment, utilizing elective options effectively, and creating clear articulation agreements have all proven to be successful strategies for creating stackable credentials that cross institutional barriers. Furthermore, the work of these institutions has led to insights surrounding future improvements that can be implemented, such as by creating student-level partnerships that completely break down geographic, demographic, and philosophical barriers between community colleges and universities. This paper provides an overview of this partnership, a description of the successful strategies that should be scaled up elsewhere, and a researched discussion of how student-level partnerships may be the next big step for rural community colleges.",,2,0,Not relevant
,,Design of a modular educational robotics platform for multidisciplinary education,cp,Rose Hulman Institute Technology,Terre Haute,United States,"Wei, Zhen;Berry, Carlotta A.","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"Mobile robotics is inherently a multidisciplinary field due to the interaction of hardware, software, and electronics to create a machine that can sense its environment and then autonomously navigate in the world to achieve some goal or task. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, courses on mobile robotics draw students from various disciplines including computer science, computer, electrical, mechanical, and software engineering. However, teaching mobile robotics to students from multiple disciplines presents some unique challenges. For example, students in such a course may have divergent interests and skillsets. Computer science students may not take a controls course; electrical engineering students may not be familiar with kinematics; mechanical engineering students may not have electronic sensors experience. Therefore, the prerequisite knowledge and skillsets of the students will affect the course topics as well as how they are presented. These challenges also influence what types of assignments are given and how they are assessed. Although it is possible to teach robotics with a simulator, there are some important learning opportunities presented with real world hardware. For example, how to handle sensor error, odometry error, modeling errors, dynamic environments, mismatched motors, memory limitations, knowledge representation, mechanical failure, frame problems, and bandwidth limitations. Popular educational robots such as LEGO® MINDSTORMS® obscure some of these issues, which may not be ideal because there are valuable learning opportunities for students to learn how to resolve or work around these challenges. It would be ideal to have a robot platform with some flexibility such as in the programming language, interface, and programming device in order to address the needs of diverse populations. It would also be desirable to have some flexibility in the robot controller such as in the number of I/O ports, communication ports, ADC, and DAC because this flexibility will enable the expert user to customize the system to suit their unique needs while also not being overwhelming for the novice user. This flexibility also allows students to use what they are most familiar with to reduce the learning curve and enables them to achieve small robotics successes sooner. This solution will take the focus away from the implementation tool and put it on the robotics educational objective. This paper will present a solution to the need for an educational robotics platform that is suitable for divergent skill sets. It will describe the design of an economical plug and play robot to suit the needs of a mobile robotics course for students from multiple disciplines. This robot system can be programmed in JAVA, Python, Lua or C. It can also be programmed with various devices such as smartphones, tablets, or the traditional laptop computer. This mobile robotics course currently uses off the shelf or slightly modified off the shelf robots to teach robotics. The initial results will indicate that it is possible to use this modular platform in its various modes to create some of the basic behaviors required for the laboratory assignments.",,1,0,Not relevant

We propose a simulation framework to model different scenarios of multi-arm robotic assembly in space with an ever-changing harsh environment. The end goal of this project is to develop a framework that will be used to expedite development time and reduce costs for deploying and testing autonomous in-orbit satellite repairs. Simulation is a valuable, viable, and low-cost option for testing the developed algorithms without the need to recreate the orbital conditions in an elaborate and expensive laboratory environment. The proposed simulation framework uses the open-source tools: ROS Kinetic and Gazebo 7. We propose a system where robotic arms coordinate and collaborate to perform tasks autonomously, in our case, to drive a screw into a plate. A move-able robot with a 3D sensing camera maps the environment and, using image recognition and localization, notifies the arms of obstacles and the locations of the screw and plate models. The arms calculate a collision-free path to the model, grasp the object, and return to a shared location. A force-torque sensor is used for the autonomous driving of the screw into the plate - completing the assembly task. In addition to the proposed framework, we present two experimental setups accomplished with the framework, an assembly task demonstration and an object recognition, localization, and collision mapping demonstration.

One general surgery residency program utilized a Delphi process to optimize a robotic surgery curriculum and to determine key factors that might affect robotic proficiency and intraoperative independence. Design: Delphi methodology was used to gain consensus amongst robotic surgery faculty and trainees. Consensus was defined as agreement of 66.7% or above in factors that would allow a resident to independently operate in a robotic case. A panel of diverse representatives proposed factors that might affect resident robotic learning and operative experience. In a subsequent round, questions were sent through an anonymous online survey for respondents to identify factors that affect resident robotic independence.

CONCLUSIONS: Limited effort has been made to develop nontechnical skills assessment tools in RUS. Recently, there has been a shift from subjective to objective measures of nontechnical performance, as well as the development of assessments specific to RUS. However, the validity evidence supporting these nontechnical assessments is limited at this time, including their relationship to technical skills, and their impact on surgical outcomes.",Education | Interpersonal and Communication Skills | Nontechnical skill assessment | Practice-Based Learning and Improvement | Robotic surgery | Simulation | Urology residency training,6,0,Not relevant

To take advantage of these similarities, a collaborative group (Nordic Renal Cancer Group, NORENCA) was founded in 2015. Materials and methods: A questionnaire of 17 questions on renal tumor management and surgical education was designed and sent to 91 institutions performing renal tumor surgery in 2015. The response rate was 68% (62 hospitals), including 28 academic, 25 central and nine district hospitals. Hospital volume was defined as low (LVH: < 20 operations), intermediate (IVH: 20–49 operations), high (HVH: 50–99) and very high (VHVH: ≥ 100). Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: Fifteen centers were LVH, 16 IVH, 21 HVH and 10 VHVH. Of all 3828 kidney tumor treatments, 55% were radical nephrectomies (RNs), 37% partial nephrectomies (PNs) and 8% thermoablations. For RN and PN, the percentages of open, laparoscopic and robotic approaches were 47%, 40%, 13% and 47%, 20%, 33%, respectively. The mean complication rate (Clavien–Dindo 3–5) was 4.9%, and 30 day mortality (TDM) was 0.5%. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days. Training with a simulator, black box or animal laboratory was possible in 48%, 74% and 21% of institutions, respectively. Conclusions: Despite some differences between countries, the data suggest an overall general common Nordic treatment attitude for renal tumors.

Several programs have integrated robotic-based simulators and models into surgical education; however, residents’ robotic experience in the operating room is currently limited. We sought to assess the safety and feasibility of robotic cholecystectomy (RC) when independently performed by GS chief residents. METHODS: From June 2016 to October 2018, RC and laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) performed independently by chief residents on a resident staff surgical service were prospectively included. Patient demographics, intraoperative variables, and postoperative complications were analyzed and compared between both cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 20 RC and 70 LC were included. Patient characteristics, indications for surgery, and comorbidities were similar in both groups. RC was more likely to be performed electively (95% vs. 17.1%, p < 0.001). No difference in operative time, estimated blood loss, intraoperative bile duct injury, or conversion to open was observed. Patients undergoing LC had an overall longer mean length of hospital stay (2.7 days ± 2.1 vs. 0.8 days ± 0.4, p < 0.001); however, length of hospital stay was similar between RC and LC performed electively (p = 0.946). No difference in postoperative complications and 30-day readmission was observed. CONCLUSIONS: RC can be safely and independently performed by GS residents with similar outcomes as LC. Efforts should be directed toward creating a platform to bridge competent simulator skills into safe performance in the operating suite. The integration of robotic training into the core GS curriculum should be encouraged.",Resident autonomy | Robotic cholecystectomy | Robotic surgery | Robotic training | Surgical training,2,0,Not relevant

Calvin;O′Sullivan, Leonard",Journal of Surgical Education,Journal,"Objective: To create a human information–processing model for laparoscopic surgery based on already established literature and primary research to enhance laparoscopic surgical education in this context. Design: We reviewed the literature for information-processing models most relevant to laparoscopic surgery. Our review highlighted the necessity for a model that accounts for dynamic environments, perception, allocation of attention resources between the actions of both hands of an operator, and skill acquisition and retention. The results of the literature review were augmented through intraoperative observations of 7 colorectal surgical procedures, supported by laparoscopic video analysis of 12 colorectal procedures. Results: The Wickens human information-processing model was selected as the most relevant theoretical model to which we make adaptions for this specific application. We expanded the perception subsystem of the model to involve all aspects of perception during laparoscopic surgery. We extended the decision-making system to include dynamic decision-making to account for case/patient-specific and surgeon-specific deviations. The response subsystem now includes dual-task performance and nontechnical skills, such as intraoperative communication. The memory subsystem is expanded to include skill acquisition and retention. Conclusions: Surgical decision-making during laparoscopic surgery is the result of a highly complex series of processes influenced not only by the operator's knowledge, but also patient anatomy and interaction with the surgical team. Newer developments in simulation-based education must focus on the theoretically supported elements and events that underpin skill acquisition and affect the cognitive abilities of novice surgeons. The proposed human information–processing model builds on established literature regarding information processing, accounting for a dynamic environment of laparoscopic surgery. This revised model may be used as a foundation for a model describing robotic surgery.",decision-making | human information processing | laparoscopic surgery | medical device design | Medical Knowledge | Practice-Based Learning and Improvement | surgical education | Systems-Based Practice,3,0,Not relevant

Design: (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Setting: Two academic training institutions. Participants: Forty-one residents, including 19 from Brigham and Women's Hospital and 22 from the Mayo Clinic, from 3 different specialties: obstetrics and gynecology, general surgery, and urology. Intervention: Participants underwent 3 different tests: visuospatial perception testing (VSP), Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) peg transfer, and da Vinci robotic simulation peg transfer. Surgical grading from the ACGME milestones tool was obtained for each participant. Demographic and background information was also collected, including specialty, year of training, previous experience with simulated skills, and surgical interest. Standard statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, and correlations were determined using adjusted linear regression models. Measurements and Main Results: In univariate analysis, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Mayo Clinic training programs differed in times and overall scores for both the FLS peg transfer and da Vinci robotic simulation peg transfer tests (p <.05 for all). In addition, type of residency training affected time and overall score on the robotic peg transfer test. Familiarity with tasks correlated with higher score and faster task completion (p =.05 for all except VSP score). There were no differences in VSP scores by program, specialty, or year of training. In adjusted linear regression modeling, VSP testing was correlated only to robotic peg transfer skills (average time, p =.006; overall score, p =.001). Milestones did not correlate to either VSP or surgical simulation testing. Conclusion: VSP score was correlated with robotic simulation skills, but not with FLS skills or ACGME milestones. This suggests that the ability of VSP score to predict competence differs between tasks. Therefore, further investigation of aptitude testing is needed, especially before its integration as an entry examination into a surgical subspecialty.",Simulation | Surgical aptitude | Visuospatial test,3,1,Not relevant

Methods: For simulation, surgeons with varying levels of experience were instructed about bowel anastomosis robotic surgical simulation in a short educational video. All participants performed the required steps for the intracorporeal bowel anastomosis under standardized conditions. The procedure consists of the following steps: division of the bowel with a stapler (1), incision and opening of the bowel limbs at the antimesenteric angle (2), insertion of the stapler into the 2 bowel limbs for the side-to-side anastomosis (3), and transverse closure of the anastomosis with the stapler (4). All simulations were performed using the daVinci SI robotic system. Face and content validity were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Construct validity was evaluated using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills, a validated global performance rating scale. Results: Twenty-two surgeons participated including 6 robotic experts and 16 trainees. The expert participants rated the bowel anastomosis model highly for face validity (median 4/5; 64% agree or strongly agree), and all participants rated the content as a training model very highly (median 4.5/5; 100% agree or strongly agree). Discrimination between experts and trainees using Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills demonstrated construct validity (novice 17.6 vs expert 24.7, P =.03). Conclusion: We demonstrate that the bowel anastomosis robotic surgical simulator is a reproducible and realistic simulation that allows for an objective skills assessment.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited OB/GYN residency programs in the United States. Participants: Residency program directors, gynecology simulation faculty, obstetrics simulation faculty, and fourth-year residents. Results: Of 673 invited participants, 251 (37.3%) completed the survey. Among the survey responses, OB procedures were more broadly represented compared to the GYN procedures for simulation teaching: 8 (50%) of 16 OB procedures versus 4 (18.2%) of 22 GYN procedures had simulation teaching. Among the simulated procedures, a majority of residents and faculty reported that simulation teaching was available for operative vaginal delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, perineal laceration repair, conventional laparoscopic procedures, and robotic surgery. There were significant differences between residents and faculty perceptions regarding the availability and needs of simulated procedures with a minority of residents having knowledge of Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (47.2%) and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (27.8%) simulation tools compared to the majority of faculty (84.7% and 72.1%, respectively). More than 80% of trainees and faculty reported they felt the average graduating resident could perform vaginal, laparoscopic, and abdominal hysterectomies independently. Conclusions: Simulation is now widely available for both gynecologic and obstetric procedures, but there remains tremendous heterogeneity between programs and the perceptions of residents, program directors, and faculty. The variations in simulation training and readiness for performing different procedures following residency support the need for objective, validated assessments of actual performance to better guide resident learning and faculty teaching efforts.",gynecology | needs assessment | obstetrics | surgical performance | surgical simulation,4,0,Not relevant

Methods: Forty-five patients were enrolled and divided into 3 groups according to chronological trends (each containing 15 patients). Three robot-naive surgeons in a single center completed VUA in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) following robotic virtual reality simulator (RVRS) training. The practicing tool used in robotic virtual reality simulator was Tube 3, which was invented for the dV-Trainer that imitates a VUA in RARP. The effects of performance were investigated by analyzing the number of repetitions and the time required to complete the task until achieving the predetermined proficiency level. Results: The targeted time (predetermined proficiency level) for completing tasks of Tube 3 and the number of required task repetitions to achieve the proficiency level were 283.1 s and 36 times, respectively, whereas in actual VUA procedures, the number of required attempts was 24, with an average time of 14.9 minutes. The mean time for completing VUA in real surgery significantly decreased with serial cases among all surgeons (1-15 vs 16-30 vs 31-45 cases, P <.001), as well as comparisons between groups (P <.001). Conclusion: The Tube 3 module can represent a valuable educational tool for procedure-specific robotic training by bridging the gap between safe acquisition of surgical skills and effective performance during actual VUA in RARP.",,4,0,Not relevant

Methods of Study Selection: A literature search of Google Scholar and PubMed using terms related to robotic surgery and robotics training, as mentioned in the “Data Sources” section. Results: Multiple novel platforms that use machine learning and real-time video feedback to teach and evaluate robotic surgical skills have been developed over recent years. Various training curricula, virtual reality simulators, and other robotic training tools have been shown to enhance robotic surgical education and improve surgical skills. The integration of didactic learning, simulation, and intraoperative teaching into more comprehensive training curricula shows positive effects on robotic skills proficiency. Few robotic surgery training curricula have been validated through peer-reviewed study, and there is more work to be completed in this area. In addition, there is a lack of information about how the skills obtained through robotics curricula and simulation translate into operating room performance and patient outcomes. Conclusion: Data collected to date show promising advances in the training of robotic surgeons. A diverse array of curricula for training robotic surgeons continue to emerge, and existing teaching modalities are evolving to keep up with the rapidly growing demand for proficient robotic surgeons. Futures areas of growth include establishing competency benchmarks for existing training tools, validating existing curricula, and determining how to translate the acquired skills in simulation into performance in the operating room and patient outcomes.

Nevertheless, there exists no consensus regarding a standard curriculum of simulation-based training. This study introduces an automatic, adaptive curriculum where the training session is real-time scheduled on the basis of the trainee's performances. Methods: An experimental study using the master console of the da Vinci Research Kit (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, US) was carried out to test this approach. Tasks involving fundamental skills of robotic surgery were designed and simulated in VR. Twelve participants without medical background along with twelve medical residents were randomly and equally divided into two groups: a control group, self-managing the training session, and an experimental group, undergoing the proposed adaptive training. Results: The performances of the experimental users were significantly better with respect to the ones of the control group after training (non-medical: p < 0.01; medical: p = 0.02). This trend was analogous in the non-medical and medical populations and no significant difference was identified between these two classes (even in the baseline assessment). Conclusion: The analysis of the learning of the involved surgical skills highlighted how the proposed adaptive training managed to better identify and compensate for the trainee's gaps. The absence of initial difference between the non-medical and medical users underlines that robotic surgical devices require specific training before clinical practice.

Leveraging clinical imaging modalities, 3D computerized modelling and 3D printing technology to produce affordable models complements currently available virtual simulators and paves the way for patient- and pathology-specific preoperative rehearsal. METHODS: We used polyvinyl alcohol, a dissolvable thermoplastic, to 3D print moulds that were casted with liquid platinum-cure silicone yielding flexible, low-cost MV models capable of simulating valvular tissue. Silicone-moulded MV models were fabricated for 2 morphologies: the normal MV and the P2 flail. The moulded valves were plication and suture tested in a laparoscopic trainer box with a da Vinci Si robotic surgical system. One cardiothoracic surgery fellow and 1 attending surgeon qualitatively evaluated the ability of the valves to recapitulate tissue feel through surveys utilizing the 5-point Likert-type scale to grade impressions of the valves. RESULTS: Valves produced with the moulding and casting method maintained anatomical dimensions within 3% of directly 3D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene controls for both morphologies. Likert-type scale mean scores corresponded with a realistic material response to sutures (5.0/5), tensile strength that is similar to real MV tissue (5.0/5) and anatomical appearance resembling real MVs (5.0/5), indicating that evaluators 'agreed' that these aspects of the model were appropriate for training. Evaluators 'somewhat agreed' that the overall model durability was appropriate for training (4.0/5) due to the mounting design. Qualitative differences in repair quality were notable between fellow and attending surgeon.

Subjects and Methods: This longitudinal, observational study analysed results from nine European Association of Urology hands-on-training courses in VR simulation. In all, 223 participants ranging from novice to expert robotic surgeons completed 1565 exercises. Competency was set at 75% of the mean expert score. Benchmark scores for all general performance metrics generated by the simulator were calculated. Assessment exercises were selected by expert consensus and through learning-curve analysis. Three basic skill and two advanced skill exercises were identified. Results: Benchmark scores based on expert performance offered viable targets for novice and intermediate trainees in robotic surgery. Novice participants met the competency standards for most basic skill exercises; however, advanced exercises were significantly more challenging. Intermediate participants performed better across the seven metrics but still did not achieve the benchmark standard in the more difficult exercises. Conclusion: Benchmark scores derived from expert performances offer relevant and challenging scores for trainees to achieve during VR simulation training.

The present study employs sensor-based kinematics and recorded surgeon experience for evaluating a new haptic device. Methods: Thirty surgeons performed a task simulating micromanipulation with neuroArmPLUSHD and two commercially available hand-controllers. The surgical performance was evaluated based on subjective measures obtained from survey and objective features derived from the sensors. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the hand-controllers and regression analysis was used to identify the key features and develop a machine learning model for surgical skill assessment. Findings: MANCOVA tests on objective features demonstrated significance (α = 0.05) for time (p = 0.02), errors (p = 0.01), distance (p = 0.03), clutch incidents (p = 0.03), and forces (p = 0.00). The majority of metrics were in favor of neuroArmPLUSHD. The surgeons found it smoother, more comfortable, less tiring, and easier to maneuver with more realistic force feedback. The ensemble machine learning model trained with 5-fold cross-validation showed an accuracy (SD) of 0.78 (0.15) in surgeon skill classification.

People with FP have trouble having their expressions understood: both laypersons and clinicians have difficulty understanding them and often misinterpret them, which can result in poor social interactions and poor care delivery. One way to address this problem is through better education and training, of which computational tools may prove invaluable. Thus, in this paper, we explore how to build systems that can recognize and synthesize asymmetrical facial expressions. We introduce a novel computational model of asymmetric facial expressions for BP, which we can synthesize on either virtual and robotic patient simulators. We explore this within the context of clinical education, and built a patient simulator with synthesized FP in order to help clinicians perceive facial paralysis in patients. We conducted both computational and human-focused evaluations of the model, including the feedback from clinical experts. Our results suggest that our BP model is realistic, and comparable to the expressions of people with BP.

However, empirical research examining learning styles on the effectiveness of using VR is still scarce. VR has different characteristics from other learning media and high immersiveness in a VR environment can create a sense of presence that improves learning outcomes, except for students with certain learning styles who experience cognitive overload when exploring virtual environments (Hsu et al., 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate to what extent learning styles can influence the effectiveness of VR-based learning on business ethics. This is because the effectiveness of business ethics education is indispensable along with the increasing cases of fraud and financial companies (PwC’s Global Economic Crime and Fraud, 2020). Design/methodology/approach: Education must respond to the progress of information technology (IT) development by providing IT-based teaching methods to enhance the learning process. This is because the evolution of technology is changing student learning preferences from verbal to visual or even virtual (Proserpio and Gioia, 2007). VR is an IT-based learning media that creates a virtual environment which simulates the real world and provides concrete experiences, so students are able to actively explore their course material. VR technology is able to provide practical experiences without actually leaving home, so it is relevant for responding to the current situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Compared to traditional learning, VR is a more flexible learning method as it has no limitations of time, distance and space (Yu et al., 2007). The main characteristic of VR is immersion, interaction and imagination (Zhang et al., 2017) that improve cognitive performance in engineering (Alhalabi, 2016), the military (Webster, 2016) and surgical robots (Bric et al., 2016). VR-based learning can improve students’ learning abilities compared to traditional teaching (Jena, 2016). VR has already proven effective in teaching business ethics (Sholihin et al., 2020) because VR has the ability to create a virtual world, without any impact from socially reprehensible acts. With VR, students are able to understand scenarios about ethical dilemmas that occur in business practices, observe the potential consequences and make decisions to solve concrete situations where ethical dilemmas require a response. VR allows students to simulate situations virtually and develop their long-term experience. This is crucial because there is the possibility that in the near future the society will live in a mixed world (virtual and physical space). Practical implications: A virtual environment that is able to evoke a sense of presence refers to the intensity of emotional involvement. Sense of presence can actually improve the learning results, but if the user lacks the ability to explore game tasks it will cause a cognitive overload that has a negative impact on learning outcomes (Hsu et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2020). Learning style preferences cause differences in cognitive load during the learning process using VR (Hsu et al., 2017). In a VR-based learning environment, students are required to explore the virtual environment; therefore, without navigation, students with active experimental learning styles are superior to students with passive or observing learning styles (Chen et al., 2005). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the impact of adopting VR technology to improve student’s performance by considering different learning styles. Social implications: In Indonesia, the shift from offline learning to e-learning has created new academic pressures for some students (Pajarianto et al., 2020). The main challenge for educators is how to improve student’s learning outcomes and overcome the problem of using e-learning technology. Originality/value: In light of the scarcity of research on the effectiveness of VR for teaching business ethics during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study fills the gap by extending the study of Sholihin et al. (2020) in that the authors establish the connection between user perception of the use of VR and learning style in relation to the effectiveness of VR.",Behavior | Cognition | Experiential learning | Gamification | Learning methods,0,0,Not relevant

The consequence is that decisions are based on limited perception rather than the full value and meaning of what risk is, as a result, the way it is being tackled is incorrect. The individuals are often limited in their perceptions and ideas and do not embrace the full multifaceted nature of risk. Regulators and individuals want to follow norms and checklists or overuse models, simulations, and templates, thereby reducing responsibility for decision-making. At the same time, the wider use of technology and rules reduces the critical thinking of individuals. We advance the automation process by building robots that follow protocols and forget about the part of risk assessment that cannot be programed. Therefore, with this study, the objective of this study was to discover how people define risk, the influencing factors of risk perception and how they behave toward this perception. The authors also determine how the perception differed with age, gender, marital status, education level and region. The novelty of the research is related to individual risk perception during COVID-19, as this is a new and unknown phenomenon. Methodology: The research is based on the analysis of the self-administered purposely designed questionnaires we distributed across different social media platforms between February and June 2020 in Europe and in some cases was carried out as a interview over communication platforms such as “Skype,” “Zoom” and “Microsoft Teams.” The questionnaire was divided into four parts: Section 1 was designed to collect demographic information from the participants; Section 2 included risk definition statements obtained from literature and a preliminary discussion with peers; Section 3 included risk behavior statements; and Section 4 included statements on risk perception experiences. A five-point Likert Scale was provided, and participants were required to answer along a scale of “1” for “Strongly Agree” to “5” for “Strongly Disagree.” Participants also had the option to elaborate further and provide additional comments in an open-ended box provided at the end of the section. 466 valid responses were received. Thematic analysis was carried out to analyze the interviews and the open-ended questions, while the questionnaire responses were analyzed using various quantitative methods on IBM SPSS (version 23). Findings: The results of the analysis indicate that individuals evaluate the risk before making a decision and view risk as both a loss and opportunity. The study identifies nine factors influencing risk perception. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that we can continue to develop models and rules, but as long as the risk is not understood, we will never achieve anything.",COVID-19 | Models | Risk | Risk behavior | Risk management | Risk perception,2,0,Not relevant

To model anatomy, finite element method (FEM) simulations have been held as the gold standard for calculating accurate soft tissue deformation. Unfortunately, their accuracy is highly dependent on the simulation parameters, which can be difficult to obtain. Methods: In this work, we investigate how live data acquired during any robotic endoscopic surgical procedure may be used to correct for inaccurate FEM simulation results. Since FEMs are calculated from initial parameters and cannot directly incorporate observations, we propose to add a correction factor that accounts for the discrepancy between simulation and observations. We train a network to predict this correction factor. Results: To evaluate our method, we use an open-source da Vinci Surgical System to probe a soft tissue phantom and replay the interaction in simulation. We train the network to correct for the difference between the predicted mesh position and the measured point cloud. This results in 15–30% improvement in the mean distance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across a large range of simulation parameters. Conclusion: We show a first step towards a framework that synergistically combines the benefits of model-based simulation and real-time observations. It corrects discrepancies between simulation and the scene that results from inaccurate modeling parameters. This can provide a more accurate simulation environment for surgeons and better data with which to train algorithms.",Deep learning | Error correction | FEM | Robotic surgery | Simulation | Soft tissue deformation,4,0,Not relevant

Furthermore, the authors discuss the tactics in which information technology is used to implement business strategies to transform businesses and to incentivise the implementation of these technologies in current or future emergency situations. Design/methodology/approach: The review provides the rapidly growing literature on the use of smart technology during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The 127 empirical articles the authors have identified suggest that 39 forms of smart technologies have been used, ranging from artificial intelligence to computer vision technology. Eight different industries have been identified that are using these technologies, primarily food services and manufacturing. Further, the authors list 40 generalised types of activities that are involved including providing health services, data analysis and communication. To prevent the spread of illness, robots with artificial intelligence are being used to examine patients and give drugs to them. The online execution of teaching practices and simulators have replaced the classroom mode of teaching due to the epidemic. The AI-based Blue-dot algorithm aids in the detection of early warning indications. The AI model detects a patient in respiratory distress based on face detection, face recognition, facial action unit detection, expression recognition, posture, extremity movement analysis, visitation frequency detection, sound pressure detection and light level detection. The above and various other applications are listed throughout the paper. Research limitations/implications: Research is largely delimited to the area of COVID-19-related studies. Also, bias of selective assessment may be present. In Indian context, advanced technology is yet to be harnessed to its full extent. Also, educational system is yet to be upgraded to add these technologies potential benefits on wider basis. Practical implications: First, leveraging of insights across various industry sectors to battle the global threat, and smart technology is one of the key takeaways in this field. Second, an integrated framework is recommended for policy making in this area. Lastly, the authors recommend that an internet-based repository should be developed, keeping all the ideas, databases, best practices, dashboard and real-time statistical data.

Quadruped robots were developed and inspired by mammals, which are known to exist in most areas on the earth's land surface. However, quadruped robots cannot achieve such an ideal state due to various reasons. At present, the adaptive problem of quadruped robots under a complex and changeable terrain has made significant progress, as reported in related literature. However, the case of robots that are as flexible as mammals in nature and meet the needs of multi-functional and multi-scenarios are still poorly understood. A quadruped robot is prone to posture instability when dynamically traveling in a ground environment with variable rigidity. This work proposes a real-time adjustment strategy of the active variable stiffness of the legs. This strategy estimates the landing in real time based on the motion state of the fuselage and legs after the robot touches the ground. The coupling stiffness of the legs and the ground and the difference between the coupling stiffness of the front and rear legs and the ground is compensated to the corresponding landing legs. This enables the robot to quickly adapt to the ground with different stiffness characteristics after landing, especially when the ground stiffness differs greatly. The Simulink-SimMechanics simulation platform is established with the diagonal legs on the same stiffness ground and on different ground environments with variable stiffness. The active leg stiffness adjustment strategy combined with conventional attitude feedback control is tested, and results are compared with those using only a conventional attitude feedback control. Results show that through the active variable stiffness of the legs, the quadruped robot realizes the compensation and correction of the pitch and roll angle of the fuselage during the transition between soft and hard ground. Moreover, the control effect is better than that of the conventional attitude feedback control alone.",Actively variable stiffness | Attitude control | Ground with varying stiffness | Quadruped robot | Transition between soft and hard ground,0,0,Not relevant

To this end we conceptualize a programming paradigm that provides stimulus and sensor control functions for real-time manipulation of physical biological matter. Additionally, a simulation mode facilitates higher user throughput, program debugging, and biophysical modeling. To evaluate this paradigm, we implemented a JavaScript-based web toolkit, “Bioty,” that supports real-time interaction with swarms of phototactic Euglena cells hosted on a cloud laboratory.

Numerous studies have demonstrated a worrisome decline in low- and medium-income employment resulting from the replacement of human workforce with machines. A seminal study by Frey and Osborne in 2013 predicted that 47% of the 702 examined occupations in the United States faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 10–25 years as a result of computerization. Despite the seemingly dystopian future foreshadowed by these numbers, the wholesale replacement of labor by machines will most likely not become a reality in the foreseeable future for an array of reasons, including the creativity required by many occupations and interventions by governments. However, despite the barriers, computerization is likely to have a significant effect on the current market. In this paper, we aim to track the relative quantities of jobs that are either susceptible or non-susceptible to computerization in the future, by developing and utilizing an analytical model using Markov chains. Various simulations performed using this model demonstrate the importance of intervention policies, such as improved technical education of the public, in controlling the rate of computerization.

Such simulated training is perceived as beneficial for imparting the required practical skills to students. Considering the aging world population, this study aimed to develop a robot patient for training nursing students in the sit-to-stand (STS) transfer skill, which is indispensable in caring for elderly people. To assess a student’s skill, the robot patient should be able to access the skill correctness and behave according to whether the skill is correctly or incorrectly implemented. Accordingly, an STS control method was proposed to reproduce the different STS movements during correct and incorrect applications of the skill by the nurses. The lower limbs of a prototype robot were redesigned to provide an active joint with a compliant unit, which enables the measurement of external torque and flexibility of the human joint to be reproduced. An experiment was conducted with four nurse teachers, each of whom was asked to demonstrate both correct and incorrect STS transfer skills. The results of the external torque and joint torque measured in robot’s lower limbs revealed that a significant difference (p < 0.05) between correct and incorrect skills. It also indicates the introduction of the proposed control method for the robot can satisfy the requirement of the assessment of STS skill. Among the various measurements conducted, the external torque of the hip joint exhibited the most significant difference and therefore represented the most robust measure for assessing whether the STS transfer skill was correctly applied.",Educational robots | Human-robot interaction | Humanoid robots | Nursing education | Nursing skills,1,1,Not relevant

Conventional simulators only can mimic undeformable ROVs. Their educational capabilities are limited. The proposed simulator is developed based on advance mathematics models and is able to emulate a ROV equipped with movable robot arms. Therefore, it can perform more realistic and meaningful simulations to enhance the training courses. We deduce a voxel-based method to calculate the mass properties of the ROV. Thus, the hydrodynamic effects caused by its robot arms can be calculated in real time. A numerical algorithm is also invented to coordinate the propellers to produce required forces and moments. Hence, the ROV can attain specified velocities, positions, and orientations under the influences of loads, sea currents, and moving robot arms. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence engine is integrated into the system to perform auto-piloting, auto-balancing, and command interpretation such that the simulator is more user friendly.

We then conduct, in a simulation environment, a within-subject user study to investigate the impact of different robot engagement cues on humans compared to a “without-engagement” condition. Results suggest that engagement communication has significantly negative influences on the human’s estimation of the simulated robots’ capability and significantly raises their expectation towards the learning outcomes, even though we do not run actual imitation learning algorithms in the experiments. Moreover, imitation behavior affects humans more than gaze does in all metrics, while their combination has the most profound influences on humans.

Reinforcement learning environments-simple simulations coupled with a problem specification in the form of a reward function-are also important to standardize the development (and benchmarking) of learning algorithms. Yet, full-scale simulators typically lack portability and paral-lelizability. Vice versa, many reinforcement learning environments trade-off realism for high sample throughputs in toy-like problems. While public data sets have greatly benefited deep learning and computer vision, we still lack the software tools to simultaneously develop-and fairly compare-control theory and reinforcement learning approaches. In this paper, we propose an open-source OpenAI Gym-like environment for multiple quadcopters based on the Bullet physics engine. Its multi-agent and vision-based reinforcement learning interfaces, as well as the support of realistic collisions and aerodynamic effects, make it, to the best of our knowledge, a first of its kind.

However, the surgical skills assessment provided by the robotic simulator is only the statistical evaluation of the stimulus input from the surgeons to the hand and foot actuators, ignoring other body movements and postures that are critical to surgical performance. As a result, performance assessments to surgical experts are not significantly higher than those achieved by novices, and surgical residents do not get the meaningful feedback to improve their skills. In order to enhance the assessment of robotic surgical skills, we employed inertial body sensors and developed a novel motion marker discovery method to determine the differences in motion patterns between expert surgeons and novices on a robotic simulator (Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA). 4 wireless inertial body sensor nodes capable of 6 degree of freedom sensing were unobtrusively attached to a subject on left wrist, right wrist, right upper arm, and left ankle and used to measure motion during a task. 6 experts and 26 novices participated and performed the Energy Dissection task.

In this approach, the learning process occurs when the agent makes some actions in the environment to get some rewards. Trying to make a balance between the new information of the environment and the current knowledge about it. In this way, the algorithm is divided into two phases: 1) the learning stage, and 2) the operational stage. In the first stage, the robot learns how to reach a known destination point from its current position. To do it, it uses the information of the environment and the rewards, to build a learning matrix that is used later during the operational stage. The main advantage of this algorithm concerning traditional control algorithms is that the learning process is carried out automatically with a recursive procedure and the result is a controller that can make the specific task, without the need for a dynamic model.

Robot-assisted surgical training is a complex issue that requires significant efforts from students and teacher. During the last two decades, simulation-based training had received active development due to wide-spread occurrence and popularization of laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgical techniques. We performed a systematic review to identify the currently available simulators for robot-assisted surgery. We searched the Medline and Pubmed, English sources of literature data, using the following key words and phrases: ""robotics"", ""robotic surgery"", ""computer assisted surgery"", ""simulation"", ""computer simulation"", ""virtual reality"", ""surgical training"", and ""surgical education"". There were identified 565 publications, which meet the key words and phrases; 19 publications were selected for the final analysis. It was established that simulation-based training is the most promising teaching tool that can be used in the training of the next generation robotic surgeons. Today the use of simulators to train surgeons is validated. Price of devices is an obvious barrier for inclusion in the program for training of robotic surgeons, but the lack of this tool will result in a sharp increase in the duration of specialists training.",da Vinci | robot-assisted surgery | simulators | training,3,0,Not relevant

We performed a research intervention including facilitation, observation and video- recordings of three play sessions organized in March-May 2020. The preliminary findings indicate how guided playing with the robot dog supported SEL through conversation about human relationships, while interaction with the real dog facilitated empathic responses through spontaneous reactions on the animal's behavior.

In this work, we try to answer these questions by studying several setups that will allow us to create an assertive social robot to act as a storyteller. We evaluate the assertiveness impression by manipulating three robot characteristics: posture, pitch, and speech rate. A within-subject study was conducted with 37 participants watching eight videos in which a social robot tells a short story. In each video, the robot presents a different setup, and the participant reports the level of assertiveness of that robot.

Design: Prospective education study (Messick validity framework). Setting: Multicenter, academic medical institutions. Participants: Residents, fellows, and faculty in obstetrics and gynecology were invited to participate at 3 institutions. Participants were categorized by experience level: fewer than 10 hysterectomies (novice), 10 to 50 hysterectomies (experienced), and more than 50 hysterectomies (expert). A total of 10 novice, 10 experienced, and 14 expert surgeons were included. Interventions: Participants completed 4 simulator modules (ureter identification, bladder flap development, colpotomy, complete hysterectomy) and a qualitative survey. Simulator recordings were reviewed in duplicate by educators in minimally invasive gynecologic surgery using the Modified Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) rating scale. Measurements and Main Results: Most participants felt that the simulator realistically simulated robotic hysterectomy (64.7%) and that feedback provided by the simulator was as or more helpful than feedback from previous simulators (88.2%) but less helpful than feedback provided in the operating room (73.5%). Participants felt that this simulator would be helpful for teaching junior residents. Simulator-generated metrics correlated with GEARS performance for the bladder flap and ureter identification modules in multiple domains including total movements and total time for completion. GEARS performance for the bladder flap module correlated with experience level (novice vs experienced/expert) in the domains of interest and total score but did not consistently correlate for the other procedural modules. Performance benchmarks were evaluated for the bladder flap module for each GEARS domain and total score. Conclusion: The modules were well received by participants of all experience levels. Individual simulation modules appear to better discriminate between novice and experienced/expert users than overall simulator performance. Based on these data and participant feedback, the use of individual modules in early residency education may be helpful for providing feedback and may ultimately serve as 1 component of determining readiness to perform robotic hysterectomy.",Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills | Robotic hysterectomy | Robotic surgery | Simulation | Surgical education,0,0,Not relevant

Compared with a single, large aquatic manned or unmanned surface vehicle, a highly distributed aquatic swarm system with several AACs features advantages in numerous real-world maritime missions, and its natural potential is qualified for new classes of tasks that uniformly feature low cost and high efficiency through time. This article develops an inexpensive AAC based on an embedded-system companion computer and open-source autopilot, providing a verification platform for education and research on swarm algorithm on water surfaces. A topology communication network, including an inner communication network to exchange information among AACs and an external communication network for monitoring the state of the AAC Swarm System (AACSS), was designed based on the topology built into the Xbee units for the AACSS. In the emergence control network, the transmitter and receiver were coupled to distribute or recover the AAC. The swarm motion behaviors in AAC were resolved into the capabilities of go-to-waypoint and path following, which can be accomplished by two uncoupled controllers: speed controller and heading controller. The good performance of velocity and heading controllers in go-to-waypoint was proven in a series of simulations. Path following was achieved by tracking a set of ordered waypoints in the go-to-waypoint. Finally, a sea trial conducted at the China National Deep Sea Center successfully demonstrated the motion capability of the AAC. The sea trial results showed that the AAC is suited to carry out environmental monitoring tasks by efficiently covering the desired path, allowing for redundancy in the data collection process and tolerating the individual AACs’ path-following offset caused by winds and waves.",Autonomous aquatic craft | Autonomous aquatic craft swarm system | Decentralized control | Marine environment monitoring | Swarm robotics | Unmanned surface vehicles,4,0,Not relevant

We participate in a variety of robotics competitions including FIRST [1], Robocar [2], and RoboSub [3], an international collegiate level competition. In 2020, our team placed #1 against 33 university and high school teams making history as the youngest team to earn this title. In 2021 our team was accepted to compete in RobotX 2022 [4], an international collegiate competition utilizing an autonomous boat and drone working together. In 2011, our coaches created a team and imagined that one day, the elementary school students playing with Lego robots would grow to compete in RoboSub and beyond. Prior to 2019, our team only had experience with ground robots. We took advice and inspiration from experienced teams and connected with marine technology companies to seek mentorship. With the mentorship from professionals, we were encouraged to push ourselves. Through our speaker series, we learned from many professionals from a variety of STEM fields, especially from those in the marine industry. We learned alongside other students about the far-reaching applications of STEM. In 2019, we began our RoboSub journey starting with the basics: A simple remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) constructed by plastic pipes, brushless motors and on-off control box. We climbed up the complexity scale to prototyping on breadboards and using a reliable off-the-shelf Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) from Blue Robotics called BlueROV2 [5]. Learning from these platforms, we designed and built our custom AUV, Orange in 2019. The following year we developed Græy which took Orange's design and improved upon it by adding more capabilities and sensors to incorporate intersub communication. In 2021, adapting to the virtual season we created an open source Unity simulation of the RoboSub competition environment to help our team and others to test their systems. We strive to apply our experience in RoboSub to benefit the local and global STEM education community. Thus, we began collaborating with Porpoise Robotics [6], a team of former submarine engineers, to design low cost underwater ROV to make STEM education more accessible. The ROV is designed to be an affordable robot which can be used to teach STEM, especially robotics and mechatronics, in schools. Sitting well within a consumer price range, the ROV gives schools the opportunity to immerse their students in underwater robotics. In addition to developing the ROV, we have been working with Porpoise Robotics to create a 2-week curriculum for schools to use with the ROV which will aim to teach students Python, underwater dynamics, mechanics, and electrical integration. By teaching young students about basic principles of marine technology and innovation, we hope to inspire them to explore their interest in the field of ocean engineering.

All RoboCup leagues contribute to this goal, for example the Simulation Leagues with research on strategic game play, the Standard Platform League with stable walking and vision algorithms and the Humanoid League with mechatronics of bipedal robots. However, especially in the Humanoid League, the swift improvement in performance of the robots makes it significantly harder for newcomers to enter into this field of research. With robots increasing in size, with new challenges in mechatronics for bipedal robots and software increasing in complexity, the gap for new teams is widening on the course to the 2050 game. There have been many approaches to easy entry, such as the introduction of a two-league system in the Standard Platform (SPL) and Small Size League (SSL) or an â€˜educational challengeâ€™ at regional @home events. While the SPL and SSL approaches require fully developed hard- and software in order to compete, as the @home challenge, we propose an entry-level league with a reduced set of requirements to bridge the gap between the Junior level and advanced Humanoid League. We believe that the Humanoid League can only reach the 2050 goal if new researchers and universities can be attracted on a regular basis. Attracting new researchers requires an easy entry path for new teams, suitable for undergraduate students and universities with a limited budget. The â€˜Humanoid Rookie (Sub-) Leagueâ€™ (HRL) will give new researchers and teams the time to gather experience and funds that are necessary to successfully participate in and contribute to the Humanoid Leagueâ€™s development towards the 2050 game.

At the same time, IT technology is receiving more attention as a career path because of the increased emphasis on the importance of software education required by today’s economy. In this research, a science-art-IT convergence program, STEAM, was developed and applied to Korean middle schools under the free semester system program and its effectiveness was tested. The program was developed by a five researcher team which consisted of specialists in art and STEAM education as well as middle school teachers who held teaching positions at school. The program developed in this research consisted of ten class periods where students used the Arduino program to create robotic art to simulate the Western masterpiece paintings. The program was implemented at middle schools that were running free semester systems. A pre and post test was performed on the attitude of participating students in various areas in order to study how they felt about the program. The assessment areas included: student’s interest in the subjects, communication/caring, self-guided learning, and career choice in science and engineering. The result showed that the class was effective in improving students’ interest in math and science subjects; self-concept in science; and a career choice in science and engineering. Also, the students were relatively satisfied with the program overall. The research concluded that the science-art-IT program can contribute to solving one of the most important problems associated with operating free semester systems, which is providing more diverse educational programs to students.",Free semester system | Robotic art | Science-art-IT convergence | STEAM attitude,3,0,Not relevant

In this paper we update Astrobee development status, describe its software, and the ground facilities used for testing. We also describe initial uses of Astrobees as a research and educational platform, including the Zero Robotics competition for students ages 12-18. Astrobees will replace the Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) on board the ISS. Astrobees will operate inside the ISS, where they will assist astronauts, ground controllers, and researchers. The Astrobee Robot Software is the open-source, Robot Operating System (ROS) based software in charge of Astrobees' autonomous operation. The Astrobee Robot Software can be used interchangeably with an Astrobee Simulator or as Astrobee's on board software, facilitating the robot's development. In addition to simulation-based testing, further evaluation is performed using the SPHERES â€œGranite Labâ€ and â€œMicro-Gravity Test Facilityâ€ (MGTF) at NASA Ames. The Granite Lab consists of a 3m x 3m granite table used to mimic microgravity conditions in three degrees of freedom (x/y/yaw) by mounting one or multiple Astrobees on mobile air bearings to eliminate friction. This facility also replicates a section of the ISS including lighting, handrails, and the Astrobee dock. The MGTF expands on the Granite Lab's capabilities by allowing an Astrobee to maneuver with 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF). A gantry structure allows linear displacement in x-y-z, and a gimbal performs rotations about those axes. Motion is driven by a physics simulation that responds to simulated thrust command from the robot. The MGTF expands the capabilities to test Astrobee features at a higher fidelity, including path planning, obstacle avoidance, and computer vision-based mobility control algorithms. In addition to carrying out tasks to support ISS operations, Astrobee was designed to support a broad range of â€œguest scienceâ€. Guest scientists will use Astrobees to test a variety of mobile payloads and sensors, as well as carry out experiments ranging from human-robot interaction studies to examination of fluid behavior in microgravity. Industry, academia, and government researchers can run their experiments using these free-flying robots.

Since its establishment in 1999 it has developed a deep knowledge and understanding of simulated missions to Mars, culminating in six major field missions organized between 2006 and 2015 between Europe, North America and Africa. It is the only organization in Europe with a permanent Analog Astronaut Corp and, in order to support the field missions, an established Mission Support Center with trained personnel. Since the last mission, a 15 days long simulation in the Kaunertal glacier in Austria (AMADEE 15), and in preparation for the upcoming one, a month long expedition in Oman (AMADEE 18), a training program has been prepared and implemented to develop and train the skills of the volunteers who will support the mission from both the field and the Mission Support Center. This training flow is developed in parallel with the dedicated one for the Analog Astronauts, which consists of a basic training in the major areas of technical skills and emergency training supplemented by a continuous physical training, nutritional coaching, media and education and outreach activities. In addition, mission specific training is added in preparation for the major field missions, approximately one year prior to the start of the activities and progressively refined as soon as the scientific program is finalized. The training program for the Mission Support center personnel is articulated in two major milestones, which are 3 days long face to face courses held in Innsbruck, where the ÖWF headquarter and the Mission Support Center are located; those are respectively an Analog Mission Basic Training (AMBT) and an Analog Mission Advanced Training (AMAT). As said, the ÖWF is a citizen science organization open to students, professionals and in general targeting anyone with an interest in space, therefore there is a variety of backgrounds and skills, which have to be considered and integrated in the training preparation. In order to set a common level of initial knowledge, the first part of the AMBT course is developed as an online series of lectures, introducing the ÖWF history and some generic concepts on the different teams working for an analog mission, namely the Flight Control Team, Flight Planning, Remote Science Support, Information technology, Media, Field and Ground Support. In addition, some introductory readings on planetary exploration and Mars Mission Design, including the PolAres manifest, which is the interdisciplinary program lead by the ÖWF to prepare for a future robotic-human Mars mission. The concepts learned in the online part of the course are then exploited during the fact to face part of the course, in which additional communication skills are developed in preparation for the first analog Simulation, in which the participants are getting a first introduction to the Mission Support Center consoles and tools. In the same timeframe the students receive the first introduction to the Aouda Spacesuit, which is used by the Analog Astronauts during the simulated Extra-Vehicular Activities and can experience the donning and doffing as a generic task which they will support daily during a mission simulation. The knowledge acquired during the AMBT course is tested in two steps: once after the first set of online lectures and preparatory readings and then at the end of the face to face part where the students are also asked to reflect on their performance during the Simulation. The Advanced training contains a few more in depth lessons related to other important aspects of an Analog mission, such as Meteorology, Safety, Space Politics and Law and becomes more specific for the role the participant is expected to take during the mission; the group is divided in three subgroups, each one covering the aspects of Flight Planning, Flight Control Team and Field respectively. The final day of the AMAT face to face training is simulating almost an entire day of EVA during an Analog Mission, including some science experiment execution, and the students are practicing their skills and applying their recently acquired knowledge on the Operational products, tools and communication. For this advanced phase, the knowledge is tested by means of a questionnaire at completion of the online part and through the preparation of a thesis topic, assigned by the lecturers and Team Leads to each participant. Through the entire study a special relevance is also given to the psychological aspects of the Analog Mission, both as a subject to be taken into consideration while communicating to a group of people which is located on a different planet and with the introduction of the time delay, but also as a way to address each participant to the group where his/her personality and skills fit better and can be exploited to the maximum level. The interactions between Mission Support Center, field and Analog Astronauts are practiced prior to a major field mission during specific integrated Dress Rehearsals; each one of them has a specific objective and is aimed to train certain skills: the first one is centered on experiment qualification and operation, the second on procedures and contingency operation and the last one on science and experiments. They all consist of a few days of co-location in Innsbruck where the different teams have the opportunity to get to know each other and build the relationships which will be essential for a smooth and productive environment during the mission execution. The most promising students graduated from the AMAT training program are then invited by the Board to pursue a career path into the organization, becoming, after a dedicated leadership training, members of the Flight Directors team or the equivalent into the field, the Field Commander. The training concepts described above have been applied successfully to 2 classes of AMBT/AMAT graduates, one in 2016 and one in 2017; in addition, due to its success, an additional AMBT course is planned to be completed before the end of 2017; this approach has guaranteed to the Austrian Space Forum a relevant number of trained volunteers which are ready to be assigned to their duties and start the final preparation for the mission specific topics of AMADEE 18 in Oman.",,1,0,Not relevant

Training simulation software for automatic systems, process optimization, and system validation are a must-have for all production centers to do faster machine integrations and more rapid prototyping to find advantages over their competitors. The new form of system validation is known as virtual commissioning, which emulates a real industrial environment thanks to computer software, and it provides the user with a safe place to train before dealing with a problem in the real world. This technology represents an opportunity for specialized education where virtual commissioning could be used to equip control and automation laboratories in which students and trainees in automation can test, validate, and debug their control and automation strategies. Thus, the student learns by doing; the technology saves the training center money by not needing costly, industrial machinery to reinforce student understanding. The student’s practice becomes a regular habit. In our global economy, many developing nations whose primary economic activity is production feel these pressures, but their training laboratories are resource-poor and are commonly equipped with improvised homemade systems that do not represent what students will face in the real industrial environment.

In particular, the agencies are developing together the LUNA analogue facility to provide the space exploration community with a testbed to prepare for sustainable human presence on the Moon. In recent years, information technologies and robotics have evolved significantly. The present study focuses on the status of planetary exploration robotics development in Europe and identifies its important needs that are still unaddressed. The current work shows that a few enabling technologies have developed beyond what could be predicted a few years ago. Recently, computer vision and autonomous guidance, navigation and control (GNC) have both gained momentum in robotics. Unfortunately, verification and validation of these new technologies remain challenging today. Of the 28 interviewed organisations, none reported knowing a test environment that is both representative and allows repeatable experiments for computer vision or GNC. Technical tests are either done on computer simulation, where representativeness is hard to ensure, or via field simulation, where repeatability is hard to ensure. To enable representative and repeatable tests of computer vision or GNC integrated systems in LUNA, the present study found that three key needs must be addressed. First, it must allow its 600 m2 indoor regolith landscape to be modelled to a desired shape. Second, it must enable experiments to be carried out under representative lighting conditions. Third, it must provide ground truth position tracking of experimental devices. LUNA will be outfitted to enable development regarding In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), rover navigation and teleoperations and excavation and drilling, and eventually lead to crucial experience and recommendations. This facility will notably be unique as both ESA and DLR will provide more than 30 years of experience with the International Space Station (ISS).

,,A new method for teaching the fourbar linkage to engineering students,cp,Rose Hulman Institute Technology;Rowan University,Terre Haute;Glassboro,United States;United States,"Constans, Eric;Dyer, Karl;Sangelkar, Shraddha","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"The fourbar linkage is one of the first mechanisms that a student encounters in a machine kinematics or mechanism design course and teaching the position analysis of the fourbar has always presented a challenge to instructors. Position analysis of the fourbar linkage has a long history, dating from the 1800s to the present day. Here position analysis is taken to mean 1) finding the two remaining unknown angles on the linkage with an input angle given and 2) finding the path of a point on the linkage once all angles are known. The efficiency of position analysis has taken on increasing importance in recent years with the widespread use of path optimization software for robotic and mechanism design applications. Kinematicians have developed a variety of methods for conducting position analysis, but the solutions presented in the literature fall into two general families: 1. The angle between the coupler and the rocker is found using the law of cosines. Once this is known, the coupler and rocker angles are found using some combination of the laws of sines and cosines. 2. A vector loop equation is written around the linkage, and then half-angle tangent identities are used to solve for the two unknown angles. Two widely-used mechanical design textbooks use method 2, whose derivation is lengthy and whose final results permit no simple geometric interpretation. Method 1 has a much simpler derivation but is difficult to implement in software owing to a lack of four-quadrant functions for sine and cosine. With this in mind, we have developed a more efficient method for obtaining the position solution for the fourbar linkage that is well-suited to educational settings as well as for design optimization: the projection method. Because the final formulas have an elegant geometric interpretation, we have found that this method is easier for mechanical engineering students to understand and could therefore become a new standard method for mechanical design textbooks. In addition, the final position formula uses the tangent function, which has widely-available four-quadrant implementations. The projection method is easily extended to other common linkages, including the inverted slider-crank, the geared fivebar linkage, and four of the five types of single degree-of-freedom sixbar linkages. This method has been used to develop an educational website, www.mechdes.net, that contains simulations of several common linkages and mechanisms. This paper presents a comparison of the two traditional methods and the projection method, and pseudocode algorithms for each method are given at the end.",Fourbar linkage | Fourbar mechanism | Linkage optimization | Position analysis,0,0,Not relevant

Clinical training is guaranteed by the practice within University Veterinary Hospitals (UVH), but has limitations related to the scarcity of cases and the respect of animal welfare, that limit the repetition of situations. In 2012, for the first time in FNVS, the dean decided to complete clinical training at Oniris by virtual learning systems simulating situations, and called Virtual Vet this strategy. Virtual Critical Care, equipped with a high-fidelity Simdog(r) mannequin, acquired with a Chair of business with Crédit Agricole, allows to test reactions to situations of emergency and resuscitation. Were also set up, a room for self-learning basic gestures, digital training in histopathology, simulation models for internal body searches in horses and cattle, equipment for robotic surgical education.

Recently, mechatronics undergraduate programs started being developed in 2 or 4 years colleges across the nation, mainly driven by international companies operating in countries that already offer mechatronics degrees ranging from high school to doctoral programs. Most of the time there are independent mechatronics programs, mainly at the community college level, but mechatronics areas of specialization were also developed under either electrical or mechanical engineering programs, through senior elective courses. In the College of Engineering and Technology at Old Dominion University there are currently well established, accredited electrical and mechanical engineering technology programs, and steps are being taken to introduce the option for mechatronics specialization. A mechatronics concentration area was already introduced under the mechanical engineering technology (MET) program with new courses developed to provide skills in mechatronics, hydraulics, and simulation of mechatronics systems, complementing the existing courses focusing on automation, industrial robotics, computer integrated manufacturing, and computer numerical control.

Clinical medicine traditionally being conservative has seen a limited uptake of these new technologies which has seen widespread adoption in other industries. But due to disruptive nature of the pandemic, clinical medicine has also been forced to adapt and capitalize on these new technologies. Chief amongst them is the utilization of extended reality (XR) technologies, which is an umbrella term that encompasses a spectrum of virtual reality (VR) and Augmented reality (AR) devices that blend the physical world with the digital world. VR technologies immerses users in 3D worlds while AR technologies project 3D objects into the user’s physical environment while permitting full visibility of the user’s surroundings. XR technologies can assist in infection control measures by revolutionizing clinical ward rounds. Patient’s key blood results and vitals can be projected above each patient enhancing the speed of clinical ward rounds for large number of patient’s in community isolation facilities. Examination findings can then be dictated and automatically recorded. XR technologies can also assist clinicians during the planning and execution of highly infective/risky procedures. XR can help proceduralists simulate the procedure, limiting timing spent during the actual procedure. While XR guided robots can actually perform the high risk and delicate procedures, limiting infection risk for the proceduralist. XR technologies can overcome the disruption caused clinical education due to Covid-19 pandemic infection control measures. They can help simulate patient interaction/ clinical scenarios for medical students while keeping both patient and medical students safe from infection. Covid-19 has also generated much psychosocial distress due to the isolation stemming from infection control. XR technologies can be used to help bridge the psychosocial isolation by connecting patients with their family members, hobbies or home towns.

Therefore, a new element was introduced into the virtual environment - a device to simulate real objects. In the Virtual Environment (VE), user interacted with a simulated object, and the task of the Delta robot was moving into a position which enabled the interaction. In this way, VE has become more responsive because it corresponded to the behavior of the user, who can move and interact with digital objects and directly experience their physical properties (e.g. size, shape).

From the perspective of educational psychology, the influence of vocalized reading practice on the English learning of students is studied based on the self-efficacy theory and the schema theory. To encourage the students to practice English, the study might solve the problem of insufficient opportunities by applying the artificial intelligence (AI) chat system to the oral English practice of the students. Several research hypotheses are put forward, which concern the correlation between the English learning anxiety of the students with their self-efficacy, topic familiarity, and English grades under vocalized reading practice. Then, the hypotheses are verified through a controlled trial and a questionnaire survey (QS). Afterward, the experimental and QS data are statistically analyzed and tested with a regression model. The results show that the English grades, self-efficacy, and topic familiarity of the students have been significantly improved in the experimental group after the vocalized reading practice. The significance coefficient of the regression model is P = 0.000 < 0.05, which can be used to verify the proposed hypotheses.

Over the past 200 years, popular culture has considered the imaginary consequences of the danger to humanity and human-ness of replicating the autonomous human form too faithfully. Today, the seductive allure of technologically advanced simulated human bodies and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence has brought us closer to facing this possibility. Alongside the simultaneous aversion and fascination of the possibility that autonomous simulated human forms may become indistinguishable from human beings is the deep-rooted uncanniness of the automaton in its strange familiarity – not only to ourselves but to our pleasant childhood imaginings of playing with dolls. As such, simulated human bodies are often enrolled in medical and nursing education models with the assumption that making the simulation teaching spaces seem as close to clinical spaces as possible will allow students to practise potentially harmful clinical skills without causing any harm to human patients. However similar the simulated human bodies may appear to a living, breathing human, a tension between the embodiment of particularly human attributes and their replication persists. How can computerized human patient simulators be enrolled to teach people to develop the necessary attributes of compassion and empathy when caring for human beings? This article explores the uncanny ecologies of simulated human patients in nursing education by presenting a posthuman analysis of the practices of nurse educators as they enrol these digital objects in their teaching. Guided by a selection of heuristics offered as a mode of interviewing digital objects, the analysis enrolled ‘Gathering Anecdotes’ and ‘Unravelling Translations’ to attune to the ways in which these uncanny posthuman assemblages become powerful modes of knowing to mobilize learning about human attributes within uncanny posthuman ecologies.",High-fidelity simulation education | Nursing education | Object interviews | Posthuman ecologies | Sociomateriality | The uncanny empathy | Translation,1,0,Not relevant

A possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3 missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team, and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis. CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London, Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015 operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as inverted paleochannels. Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12–21), were conducted with the Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020 rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22–39) was implemented without the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the Science Team prioritized 3 for “return to Earth”. Various science autonomy capabilities, based on flight-proven or near-future techniques intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016 CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and conditional sequencing were also employed. Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made. Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region, collected out-of-simulation, have been analysed using a range of laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering large suites of geological and geochemical survey data. Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook), articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016 activities had 90% of participants “somewhat agreeing” or “strongly agreeing” that participation in the mission has helped them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.",Analogue missions | Astrobiology | Autonomous science | Geology | Mars | Mars sample return | Rovers | Utah,22,0,Not relevant

ROS has therefore been extensively taught in robotics program in electrical engineering programs. However, although it is a low-cost solution to allowing students to perform a variety of simulations and validating new algorithms before implementing them on an actual mobile robot, teaching ROS so that students can use it efficiently and effectively is a challenging task. Regular electrical engineering courses on ROS may focus on theories but neglect hands-on experiences. Traditional lab-driven pedagogy may provide hands-on opportunities on ROS itself but may still not bring students close enough to the actual applications of ROS to their major robot projects in their electrical engineering education. In this paper, a technological content knowledge (TCK) based method is utilized to create learning opportunities that allow students to construct their knowledge of the technology/tool (the T) in close relation to the content/robot programming (the C). The multi-lab-driven method (MLDM) was employed to construct the TCK of ROS of students in the context of designing an autonomous mobile robot system. A sequence of multiple labs were assigned to students to cover various topics in the ROS.

Based on students' performance on various lab assignments, lab reports, presentations, the final robot project, students' input to the official course evaluation administered by the university, and a comparison to the instructor's previous years of teaching experience, we propose that the MLDM is effective in helping students to learn ROS efficiently and meaningfully in the real world of engineering projects.

The implementation of artificial neural circuits to control robots generally involves the following tasks: (1) understanding the simulation tools, (2) creating the neural circuit in the neural simulator, (3) linking the simulated neural circuit with the environment of the agent and (4) programming the appropriate interface in the robot or agent to use the neural controller. The accomplishment of the above-mentioned tasks can be challenging, especially for undergraduate students or novice researchers. This paper presents an alternative tool which facilitates the simulation of simple SNN circuits using the multi-agent simulation and the programming environment Netlogo (educational software that simplifies the study and experimentation of complex systems). The engine proposed and implemented in Netlogo for the simulation of a functional model of SNN is a simplification of integrate and fire (I&F) models. The characteristics of the engine (including neuronal dynamics, STDP learning and synaptic delay) are demonstrated through the implementation of an agent representing an artificial insect controlled by a simple neural circuit.

In this preliminary experiment, a humanoid robot, Aldebaran's Nao, was programmed to recite a mystery story to 60 students aged 14 to 15, while engaging them through gestures, simulated eye contacts and varied voices. Nao delivered the performance as either an independent storyteller, or as a collaborator with a human storyteller. We assessed the effectiveness of HRC by comparing the participants' preference over the two settings. We found that 1) most participants believe that HRC is effective and prefer HRC over the robot-only performance; and 2) the complementarily effective roles of human and robot storytellers in interacting with the participants provide a glimpse of evidence on the preference towards HRC. These results, provide a first step towards effective use of robots for collaborative storytelling in day-to-day situations, which is well placed to guide the design of robots for education and entertainment purposes, e.g. for improving family bonding between parents and children while allowing parents to more effectively tell stories.",,6,0,Not relevant

Computer games became the mostly preferred spare time activity for children of different ages. Several studies found that technology, ranging from computer applications to social robots, can act as a mediator to improve interaction for children with social impairments. The contribution presented is an intermediate step which combines the embodiment with tangible and intuitive interaction that social robots can offer and an affordable and autonomous solution as a computer game. Probogotchi is a way to play an educational computer game, where children have to interact with a toy equipped with sensors connected to a PC. The control architecture is built around an artificial homeostatic system for social agents and is set to simulate pet-like behavior, resulting in a dependency on the user's interactions. As such, affective human-computer interaction is achieved. The homeostatic regulation is an autonomous system that uses input stimuli from a tactile and object identification system to detect certain actions originating from the user. If an action is triggered, it will influence the internal needs that are subsequently translated into an emotional state. This emotional state is communicated back to the user by a virtual model showing the corresponding facial expression. For the evaluation section, a preliminary study using Probogotchi as a bridge for interaction between a child with ASD and his typically developed sibling is for the first time described. Quantitative data and qualitative observations are presented. The paper concludes with a focus on the technical limitations and also on future developments and implications for the clinical use of Probogotchi game for children with autism.",Autism spectrum disorder | Computer games | Social skills,7,0,Not relevant

Current engineering education institutions produce engineers who are great scientists - knowledgeable in engineering science, mathematics and analytical techniques, and research, but are nonetheless mediocre in the design of components, processes, or systems. In this paper we argue that the engineering education design curriculum, through project-based learning, offers students the opportunities to experience engineering design the way it is practiced and simulated in industry. Data for the study constitutes analyses, using three categories: knowledge, skills, and values, of the students' performance in a mechanical engineering product design course. Students were required to: Design a 21/2 axis Basic SCARA ROBOT (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) for a given application. A survey from graduate students working in industry shows that that project-based learning, enabled them to effectively function in an industrial atmosphere where designing products were the mainstay. In addition, a one-way ANOVA test shows that there were strong associations observed in the development of skills between: knowledge and skills (p = 0.001); and skills and values (p = 0.0008).",engineering-design course | product design | project-based learning | world of work,9,1,Not relevant

To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, computer simulations using Matlab and hardware experiments were conducted. Variation of load was applied to both of the processes to present the uncertainties. The superiority of the proposed controller over the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller that usually being used in a low-cost robotic arm development is confirmed that it has better trajectory tracking. The error tracking along the slope of sinusoidal trajectory input was suppressed to zero. The biggest error along the trajectory that happened on every peak of the sinusoidal input, or when the direction is changed has been improved from 15 degrees to 4 degrees.

In an effort to summarize the current state of research, and identify specific types of technologies that have recently “emerged” in K-12 science classrooms, we review papers featured in leading science education venues in recent years. The reported trends suggest that, as a field, science education has become increasingly characterized by hermeneutic and alterity relations wherein the physical world is experienced indirectly through technological representations or has become secondary to students' experiences as it is “pushed aside” by emergent technological artifacts such as computer simulations, virtual labs, mobile devices, robots, games, and digital photography and drawing. As a result, science educators are faced with the challenge of helping students view technological instruments not as transparent and neutral devices that simply “depict reality” (naïve instrumentalism) and reveal what is “really” there (naïve realism), but as powerful epistemic tools that help co-constitute the reality being investigated, often (re)shaping what counts as “real” in revolutionary ways.

Images were converted to a 3D surface mesh file for fabrication using a multi-jet 3D printer. A novel construction technique was employed to approximate normal renal tissue texture, printers selectively deposited photopolymer material forming the outer shell of the kidney, and subsequently, an agarose gel solution was injected into the inner cavity recreating the spongier renal parenchyma. We constructed seven models of renal units with suspected malignancies. Partial nephrectomy and renorrhaphy were performed on each of the replicas. Subsequently all patients successfully underwent robotic partial nephrectomy. Average tumor diameter was 4.4 cm, warm ischemia time was 25 min, RENAL nephrometry score was 7.4, and surgical margins were negative. A comparison was made between the seven cases and the Tulane Urology prospectively maintained robotic partial nephrectomy database. Patients with surgical models had larger tumors, higher nephrometry score, longer warm ischemic time, fewer positive surgical margins, shorter hospitalization, and fewer post-operative complications; however, the only significant finding was lower estimated blood loss (186 cc vs 236; p = 0.01). In this feasibility study, pre-operative resectable physical 3D models can be constructed and used as patient-specific surgical simulation tools; further study will need to demonstrate if this results in improvement of surgical outcomes and robotic simulation education.",Additive manufacturing | Nephron sparing surgery | Renal cell carcinoma | Surgical simulation | Three-dimensional models | Three-dimensional printer,50,0,Not relevant

Personalizing this agent's behavior to the student player is an active area of research, and prior work has demonstrated the benefits of personalized educational interaction across a variety of domains. A critical research challenge for personalized educational agents is real-time student modeling. Most student models are designed for and trained on only a single task, which limits the variety, flexibility, and efficiency of student player model learning. In this paper we present a research project applying transfer learning methods to student player models over different educational tasks, studying the effects of an algorithmic ""multi-task personalization""approach on the accuracy and data efficiency of student model learning.We describe a unified robotic game system for studying multi-task personalization over two different educational games, each emphasizing early language and literacy skills such as rhyming and spelling.We present a flexible Gaussian Process-based approach for rapidly learning student models from interactive play in each game, and a method for transferring each game's learned student model to the other via a novel instance-weighting protocol based on task similarity.We present results from a simulation-based investigation of the impact of multi-task personalization, establishing the core viability and benefits of transferrable student models and outlining new questions for future in-person research.",Educational Games | Human-Robot Interaction | Transfer Learning | User Modeling,1,0,Not relevant

Here we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm extended with active state-specific exploration and show its applicability to child engagement maximization as well as more classical tasks such as maze navigation. We first demonstrate its adaptive nature on a continuous maze problem as an enhancement of the classic grid world. There, parameterized actions enable the agent to learn single moves until the end of a corridor, similarly to ""options"" but without explicit hierarchical representations.We then apply the algorithm to a series of simulated scenarios, such as an extended Tower of Hanoi where the robot should find the appropriate speed of movement for the interacting child, and to a pointing task where the robot should find the child-specific appropriate level of expressivity of action. We show that the algorithm enables to cope with both global and local non-stationarities in the state space while preserving a stable behavior in other stationary portions of the state space.

Many solutions with a focus on the results rather than the details of the interactions between the objects in the real and virtual worlds have been developed.

In order to improve the users' feel of immersion further and to simulate more realistic operations in VR, a procedure-oriented approach for the combination of real and virtual environments is proposed here.

This prototype is designed based on a game-based virtual la-oratory system, and the specific implementation is a planetary gear train experiment. In this experiment, all models of the parts with the information required for the assembly are created, labeled and added to the database of the virtual laboratory system. The physical parts are marked in order to facilitate object recognition and object tracking. During the experiment, the main assembly with one missing planetary gear is accomplished in a purely virtual environment. In the real world, the missing planetary gear is tracked by a Kinect while the user is manipulating this gear. Then, the system recognizes this gear based on the markers and couples the corresponding virtual model of that gear with the avatar's hand in the virtual environment. Afterward, the cam-era tracks the real part, and the user can adjust its pose and location to finish the final assembly.

In recent years the idea of using video game technology in surgical education for laparoscopy has also been explored, however few have attempted to make a connection between video game experience and robotic surgical skills. Thus, the current study aims to examine the performance of video gamers in a virtual reality robotic surgery simulator. Furthermore, the video gamers' performance was compared to that of medical students, expert robotic surgeons, and 'laypeople.' The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that video gamers acquire perceptual and psychomotor skills through video game play, similar to those used by robotic surgeons. Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire and performed three computer-based perceptual tests: a Flanker compatibility task, a subsidizing task, and a Multiple Object Tracking test. Participants then performed two warm-up exercises and eight trials of two core exercises on a robotic surgery simulator. After completing all trials, participants completed a post-questionnaire regarding their experience with the system. Expert video gamers (n=40), medical students (n=24), laypeople (n=42) and expert robotic surgeons (n=16) were recruited. Medical students and gamers were significantly faster than experts in the Flanker Task. The experts were significantly slower than the all other groups in the subsidizing task. Experts scored significantly higher, were significantly more efficient, and were significantly faster than laypeople, medical students, and gamers in the first trial of Ring & Rail 1 and Suture Sponge. In trial eight of the simulation exercises, the experts performed significantly better than most groups in all of the metrics. Contrary to prior literature in laparoscopy, this study was unable to validate enhanced abilities of video gamers in a robotic surgery simulator. This study does further demonstrate that the transfer of skills developed through video game play is relevant to the surgical technique.

We present an assessment of the validity and cost-effectiveness of virtual and augmented reality simulation, animal, cadaver and synthetic organ models. Face, content, construct, concurrent and predictive validity criteria were applied to each simulation model. There are six major commercial simulation machines available for robot-assisted surgery. The validity of virtual reality (VR) simulation curricula for psychomotor assessment and skill acquisition for the early phase of robotic surgery training has been demonstrated. The widespread adoption of VR simulation has been limited by the high cost of these machines. Live animal and cadavers have been the accepted standard for robotic surgical simulation since it began in the early 2000s. Our review found that there is a lack of evidence in the literature to support the use of animal and cadaver for robotic surgery training. The effectiveness of these models as a training tool is limited by logistical, ethical, financial and infection control issues. The latest evolution in synthetic organ model training for robotic surgery has been driven by new 3D-printing technology. Validated and cost-effective high-fidelity procedural models exist for robotic surgery training in urology. The development of synthetic models for the other specialties is not as mature. Expansion into multiple surgical disciplines and the widespread adoption of synthetic organ models for robotic simulation training will require the ability to engineer scalability for mass production.

We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications.

The tumor treatment is not limited to traditional open surgery, large-area radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and other extensive treatment methods. The popularization of individualized precision surgery planning means that ""precision medicine"" is gradually applied to clinical surgery, and ""precision medicine"" mode will also make the treatment of tumor enter a new research area. The physiological anatomy and pathological changes of various organs of the human body are presented as a three-dimensional shape, while medical teaching images, diagnostic medical images, and various endoscopic surgery images are mostly plane images. However, how to interpret them often depends on the professional experience of doctors. This plane display mode limits the effect of medical training, the accuracy of interpretation of diagnostic images and the efficiency of surgical operation. Modern science and technology, stereo display technology provides a carrier with a higher realistic simulation degree for binocular vision function and training and has become a joint research hotspot in the field of computer vision and clinical medicine. Before minimally invasive surgery (MIS), compared with the traditional planar display technology, the immersive stereoscopic display technology can provide more vivid and accurate 3D human physiological and pathological images, making it easier for doctors to judge the layers, shapes, blood vessels and other complex structures and anatomical relations of lesions. At the same time, it can also provide immersive surgical situation simulation for medical training, help doctors quickly master surgical skills, further improve the efficiency of medical diagnosis and reduce the risk of surgery. In the process of minimally invasive surgery, the three-dimensional imaging navigation technology for augmented reality can not only make it easier for doctors to judge the position relationship and distance between the tissues in the surgical area and the surgical instruments, but also provide surgical navigation by superposing the preoperative examination images of the same location. Which is also achieved the accurate minimally invasive surgery. Besides, in the field of remote diagnosis and treatment, which occupies a significant proportion in the sharing of clinical medical resources, stereo display technology can provide the more accurate depth information and more dimensional image information for remote diagnosis, online consultation, and robotic surgery, so that the remote display results of medical data are more authentic and practical.

Surrogates can be directly controlled or just given a specific task to carry out on behalf of a human. In the context of a virtual environment, a surrogate is more often referred to as an avatar, reflecting that it is intended to represent the person in some context, rather than just carrying out a specific task on his or her behalf. In essence, an avatar is a manifestation of the human who is ""inhabiting"" it. A person's avatar can look like the inhabiter or look like some other person, or even be a personification of some non-human character Generally, the inhabiter controls all critical actions, verbal and non-verbal, of his or her avatar, although the specific manifestation of the avatar may place constraints on how it carries out some of these desired behaviors. The research presented here involves the use of avatars and other forms of human surrogates as remote entities that can be employed for situations that involve interpersonal skills. More specifically, we focus on the use of avatars in collaborative situations and in the delivery of training and education, especially when physical co-presence is difficult or even undesirable. In these contexts, difficulty most often relates to spatial separation of the human participants and undesirability relates to the need to have one's surrogate present an appearance and exist in a context that differs from one's own. For other situations, such as carrying out dangerous or humanly impossible physical tasks, a remote avatar may be required for safety or even successful completion. In Smart Cities, human surrogates and avatars can help make people more effective, safer, better educated and more facile at learning new skills required for employment and other life events. Our first example of the use of avatars is for teacher preparation. Here we focus on rehearsal of classroom management, content delivery and pedagogical techniques. The system we have developed to help potential and existing teachers learn new skills and hone old ones is called TeachLivE™, which stands for teaching and learning in a virtual environment. TeachLivE is in current use at over 50 universities and four school districts in the US, and one university in the United Arab Emirates. In comparison to learning skills in an actual classroom, TeachLivE harms no real children and it gives teachers the opportunity to reflect objectively on their performances, reentering the virtual classroom at a later time to improve their performances. What TeachLivE presents to its users is a virtual classroom of students, each representing the profile of a commonly encountered personality. Two extremes in current TeachLivE scenarios are a virtual student named Sean who is an aggressive-dependent in constant need of his teacher's attention and approval, and Maria who is an exceptionally talented passive-independent with no perceived need for the teacher's help or approval. Beyond personalities, each virtual student has a deep backstory and a variety of representative misconceptions related to subject matter appropriate for the student's age group - at present we have middle and high school classes, with elementary in preparation. TeachLivE is built on a platform called the AMITIES™ framework. AMITIES, which stands for Avatar-Mediated Interactive Training and Individualized Experience System, serves as middleware between the 3D rendering system (presently the industry-standard UNITY game engine) and a scenario authoring system. The AMITIES framework provides an efficient and effective infrastructure for human-in-the loop simulated experiences. Much of the system's uniqueness lies in its flexibility, allowing for a single person to simultaneously inhabit multiple avatars as well as multiple people to control multiple or even a single avatar. Achieving this has involved the development of inhabiter paradigms that focus on low cognitive and physical demand and participant paradigms that focus on situational plausibility and place illusion, plus a network protocol that delivers animated behaviors, including facial and body gestures, with very little bandwidth requirement. In addition to TeachLivE, the following is a sampling of existing uses of the AMITIES framework:. Assist trainers in employing reflective strategies.. Control robotic manifestations in remote environments.. Help students and others build protective strategies.. Improve social and job skills for children with autism..

Randolph",Surgical Clinics of North America,Journal,"A renaissance in cardiac surgery has begun. The early clinical experience with computer-enhanced telemanipulation systems outlines the limitations of this approach despite some procedural success. Technologic advancements, such as the use of nitinol U-clips (Coalescent Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) instead of sutures requiring manual knot tying, have been shown to decrease operative times significantly [31]. It is expected that with further refinements and development of adjunct technologies, the technique of computer-enhanced endoscopic cardiac surgery will evolve and may prove to be beneficial for many patients. Robotic technology has provided benefits to cardiac surgery. With improved optics and instrumentation, incisions are smaller. The ergometric movements and simulated three-dimensional optics project hand-eye coordination for the surgeon. The placement of the wristlike articulations at the end of the instruments moves the pivoting action to the plane of the mitral annulus. This improves dexterity in tight spaces and allows for ambidextrous suture placement. Sutures can be placed more accurately because of tremor filtration and high-resolution video magnification. Furthermore, the robotic system may have potential as an educational tool. In the near future, surgical vision and training systems might be able to model most surgical procedures through immersive technology [32-34]. Thus, a ""flight simulator"" concept emerges where surgeons may be able to practice and perform the operation without a patient. Already, effective curricula for training teams in robotic surgery exist [35]. Nevertheless, certain constraints continue to limit the advancement to a totally endoscopic computer-enhanced mitral valve operation. The current size of the instruments, intrathoracic instrument collisions, and extrathoracic ""elbow"" conflicts still can limit dexterity. When smaller instruments are developed, these restraints may be resolved. Furthermore, a working port incision is still required for placement of an atrial retractor, as well as needle, tissue, and suture retrieval. With the development of specialized retractors and a delivery/retrieval port, a truly endoscopic approach will be consistently reproducible. New navigation systems and image guided surgery portend an improving future for robotic cardiac surgery. Recently, we have combined robotically guided microwave catheters for ablation of atrial fibrillation with robotic mitral valve repairs (Fig. 8). Thus, we are beginning to achieve the ideal operation, with a native valve repair and a return to normal sinus rhythm. Robotic cardiac surgery is an evolutionary process, and even the greatest skeptics must concede that progress has been made toward endoscopic cardiac valve operations. Surgical scientists must continue to critically evaluate this technology in this new era of cardiac surgery. Despite enthusiasm, caution cannot be overemphasized. Surgeons must be careful because indices of operative safety, speed of recovery, level of discomfort, procedural cost, and long-term operative quality have yet to be defined. Traditional valve operations still enjoy long-term success with ever-decreasing morbidity and mortality, and remain our measure for comparison. Surgeons must remember that we are seeking the most durable operation with the least human trauma and quickest return to normalcy, all done at the lowest cost with the least risks. Although we have moved more asymptotically to these goals, surgeons alone must map the path for the final ascent.",,23,0,Not relevant

For this topic we defined, if possible, levels of evidence based on International Consultation on Urological Diseases (ICUD) and World Health Organization recommendations. Results: Obtaining renal access is one of the most important factors in training for PCNL. A resident has to perform about 24 PCNL procedures to obtain a good proficiency during the residence period.

Similar mechanism designs can be found abundantly in industrial machines or educational equipment. Currently, the major type of epicycloid or hypocycloid configurations is planetary gear trains, which contain a binary link that has one fixed and one moving pivot, and a singular link adjacent to the moving pivot. The main feature of the configurations is that any point on the singular link may describe an epicycloid or hypocycloid curve when the binary link is rotated. Presently, the major types of configurations of epicycloid (hypocycloid) mechanisms have one degree of freedom. However, at present, as far as the authors are concerned, there appears to be no approach in designing epicycloid (hypocycloid) mechanisms with two degrees of freedom. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to develop a new design method in designing new configurations of epicycloid (hypocycloid) mechanisms. This paper analyses the characteristics of the topological structures of existing planetary gear train type epicycloid (hypocycloid) mechanisms with one degree of freedom. The equation of motion and kinematical model of the mechanism was derived and appropriate design constraints and criteria were implemented. Subsequently, using the design constraints and criteria, this work designs a new and simple epicycloid (hypocycloid) mechanism that is a three-links robot and has two degrees of freedom. We can easily control the angular velocities of the binary and singular links to satisfy the criterion to draw an epicycloid (hypocycloid) curve. Additionally, an epicycloid (hypocycloid) path of a point on the three links robot is simulated by computer drawing to prove the feasibility of proposed theory.

These tests often are conducted in remote and extreme environments that are representative in one or more ways to that of future spaceflight destinations. They may also be conducted at NASA facilities, using advanced modeling and human-in-the-loop scenarios. As NASA develops a capability driven framework to transport crew to a variety of space environments, it will use analog missions to gather requirements and develop the technologies necessary to ensure successful exploration beyond low Earth orbit. NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program conducts these high-fidelity integrated tests, including the coordination and execution of a robust education and public outreach (EPO) and engagement program for each mission. Conducting these mission scenarios in unique environments not only provides an opportunity to test the EPO concepts for the particular future-mission scenario, such as the best methods for conducting events with a communication time delay, but it also provides an avenue to deliver NASA's human space exploration key messages. These analogs are extremely exciting to students and the public, and they are performed in such a way that the public can feel like part of the mission. They also provide an opportunity for crew members to obtain training in education and public outreach activities similar to what they would perform in space. The analog EPO team is responsible for the coordination and execution of the events, the overall social media component for each mission, and public affairs events such as media visits and interviews. They also create new and exciting ways to engage the public, manage and create website content, coordinate video footage for missions, and coordinate and integrate each activity into the mission timeline.

Computer Gaming is a field where AL techniques are applied. There are many successfully Alife products for pure entertainment (e.g., Tamagotchi and Creatures) and for educational objectives (e.g., Avida-Ed). However, we notice that all AL-Based games share a general flavor: they refer in someway to biological scenarios. In other terms, they represent often a sort of popularization of AL experiments designed for non-scientists. In this paper we argue that AL programming techniques (or more basically bio-inspired computational algorithms) could be used to develop generic games (e.g., sports, adventures, business games, etc.) without any relation with a biological perspective. We describe BreedBot and Learn2Lead, two Serious Games that we think could be paradigmatic examples about how to use AL techniques in different ways and fields that could be very different from their biological roots. BreedBot and its sequels (BestBot and BrianFarm) have been developed to disseminate the core-concepts of Autonomous Robotics and Learn2Lead has been developed to teach Psychological Theories of Teamwork in Small and Medium Enterprises. In BreedBot, AL techniques are used to develop the player–game interaction and they are explicitly visible by the user (he/she has to train/evolve a population of artificial agents). At the opposite side, Lear2lead has an old style appearance but it hides an AL engine.

It requires coordination of different machines to support manufacturing operations in a company. Recent studies show that there is a gap in the STEM workforce preparation in regards to highly automated production environments. Industrial robots have become an essential part of these semi-automated and automated manufacturing systems. Their control and programming requires adequate education and training in robotics theory and applications. Various engineering technology departments offer different courses related to the application of robotics. These courses are a great way to inspire students to learn about science, math, engineering, and technology while providing them with workforce skills. However, some challenges are present in the delivery of such courses. One of these challenges includes the enrollment of students who come from different engineering departments and backgrounds. Such a multidisciplinary group of students can pose a challenge for the instructor to successfully develop the courses and match the content to different learning styles and math levels. To overcome that challenge, and to spark students' interest, the certified education robot training can greatly support the teaching of basic and advanced topics in robotics, kinematics, dynamics, control, modeling, design, CAD/CAM, vision, manufacturing systems, simulation, automation, and mechatronics. This paper will explain how effective this course can be in unifying different engineering disciplines when using problem solving related to various important manufacturing automaton problems. These courses are focused on educational innovations related to the development of student competency in the use of equipment and tools common to the discipline, and associated curriculum development at three public institutions, in three different departments of mechanical engineering technology.

Illustrated textbooks offer anatomic and technical reference but do not substitute hands-on experience provided by surgery or cadaver dissection. Due to limited availability of cadaver dissections the need for development of simulation tools has been augmented. We explored simulation technology for producing virtual reality-like reconstructions of simulated surgical approaches on cadaver. Practical application of the simulation tool has been presented through frontotemporal transsylvian exposure. Methods: The dissections were performed on two cadaveric heads. Arteries and veins were prepared and injected with colorful silicon rubber. The heads were rigidly fixed in Mayfield headholder. A robotic microscope with two digital cameras in inverted cone method of image acquisition was used to capture images around a pivot point in several phases of dissections. Multilayered, high-resolution images have been built into interactive 4D environment by custom developed software. Results: We have developed the simulation module of the frontotemporal transsylvian approach. The virtual specimens can be rotated or tilted to any selected angles and examined from different surgical perspectives at any stage of dissections. Important surgical issues such as appropriate head positioning or surgical maneuvers to expose deep situated neuroanatomic structures can be simulated and studied by using the module. Conclusion: The simulation module of the frontotemporal transsylvian exposure helps to examine effect of head positioning on the visibility of deep situated neuroanatomic structures and study surgical maneuvers required to achieve optimal exposure of deep situated anatomic structures.

Objective To establish the feasibility, acceptability, face validity, and educational impact of a structured training curriculum for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), and to assess improvements in performance and ability to perform RARP after completion of the curriculum. Design, setting, and participants A 12-wk training curriculum was developed based on an expert panel discussion and used to train ten fellows from major European teaching institutions. The curriculum included: (1) e-learning, (2) 1 wk of structured simulation-based training (virtual reality synthetic, animal, and cadaveric platforms), and (3) supervised modular training for RARP. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The feasibility, acceptability, face validity, and educational impact were assessed using quantitative surveys. Improvement in the technical skills of participants over the training period was evaluated using the inbuilt validated assessment metrics on the da Vinci surgical simulator (dVSS). A final RARP performed by fellows on completion of their training was assessed using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) score and generic and procedure-specific scoring criteria. Results and limitations The median baseline experience of participants as console surgeon was 4 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 0-6.5 mo). All participants completed the curriculum and were involved in a median of 18 RARPs (IQR 14-36) during modular training. The overall score for dVSS tasks significantly increased over the training period (p < 0.001-0.005). At the end of the curriculum, eight fellows (80%) were deemed able by their mentors to perform a RARP independently, safely, and effectively. At assessment of the final RARP, the participants achieved an average score ≥4 (scale 1-5) for all domains using the GEARS scale and an average score >10 (scale 4-16) for all procedural steps using a generic dedicated scoring tool. In performance comparison using this scoring tool, the experts significantly outperformed the fellows (mean score for all steps 13.6 vs 11). Conclusions The European robot-assisted urologic training curriculum is acceptable, valid, and effective for training in RARP.

Results: The task completion rate was significantly greater for experts than for nonexperts on the virtual reality platforms (SurgicalSIM: 100% vs 36%; SEP Robot: 93% vs 63%; p < 0.05). Prior robot use was predictive of task completion on the SEP Robot, and nonexperts were more likely to complete the virtual reality task on the SEP Robot than on the SurgicalSIM. Experts performed better than nonexperts for all performance measures on the ProMIS. All the survey scores pertaining to realism except image quality were higher for the ProMIS than for either virtual reality trainer. Conclusion: The task completion rate was the best discriminant of expert performance on both virtual reality platforms, whereas simulator metrics best discriminated expertise for the videoscopic platform. Similar comparisons for the virtual reality platforms were not feasible because of the low task completion rate for nonexperts. The added degrees of freedom associated with the robotic surgical simulator instruments facilitated completion of the task by nonexperts. All platforms were perceived as effective training tools. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Laparoscopy | Robotic surgery | Surgical simulation | Virtual reality,16,0,Not relevant

A.J.;Schijven, M. P.",Surgical Endoscopy,Journal,"Background: Virtual reality (VR) as surgical training tool has become a state-of-the-art technique in training and teaching skills for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Although intuitively appealing, the true benefits of haptic (VR training) platforms are unknown. Many questions about haptic feedback in the different areas of surgical skills (training) need to be answered before adding costly haptic feedback in VR simulation for MIS training. This study was designed to review the current status and value of haptic feedback in conventional and robot-assisted MIS and training by using virtual reality simulation. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using PubMed and MEDLINE. The following search terms were used: Haptic feedback OR Haptics OR Force feedback AND/OR Minimal Invasive Surgery AND/ OR Minimal Access Surgery AND/OR Robotics AND/OR Robotic Surgery AND/OR Endoscopic Surgery AND/OR Virtual Reality AND/OR Simulation OR Surgical Training/ Education. Results: The results were assessed according to level of evidence as reflected by the Oxford Centre of Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Conclusions: In the current literature, no firm consensus exists on the importance of haptic feedback in performing minimally invasive surgery. Although the majority of the results show positive assessment of the benefits of force feedback, results are ambivalent and not unanimous on the subject. Benefits are least disputed when related to surgery using robotics, because there is no haptic feedback in currently used robotics. The addition of haptics is believed to reduce surgical errors resulting from a lack of it, especially in knot tying. Little research has been performed in the area of robot-assisted endoscopic surgical training, but results seem promising. Concerning VR training, results indicate that haptic feedback is important during the early phase of psychomotor skill acquisition. © The Author(s) 2008.",Haptic feedback | Minimal invasive surgery | Robotic surgery | Surgical training | Virtual reality,331,1,Not relevant

It enabled us to develop some useful systems such as air hockey, catch ball, tennis and horseback riding for sports field, surgical simulations and support systems for medical field, calligraphy and flower arrangement for educational field. The good training systems have force feedback for users to feel so that they can learn the skills effectively. These days, there are so many systems that use CG and VR technologies; however, there are little training systems for the Japanese art of flower arrangement. One system is a robot that can make an arranged flower according to the training data, and others are learning systems, with which people can train for flower arrangement. These systems, however, are two dimensional and do not have force feedback. Although they can learn the beauty of flower arrangement, they cannot learn the feeling when they insert flowers into pinholders. Therefore, we have developed a training system for the Japanese art of flower arrangement, which is a three dimensional system so that people can see the arranged flowers from any viewpoint. Users can also feel the tactile sense when they insert flowers into pinholders and also when flowers, which users are having, contact with other flowers. In order to make the tactile sense of flower arrangement, this system has a haptic device that can generate force feedback. By measuring the hardness of flowers with a durometer and applying the measurement results to the system, we can generate real force feedback. In order to perform fast collision detection between a flower and a pinholder or among flowers, the flower model is hierarchically constructed with some parts such as petal, stem and leaf. Each part also has one of three attributes that are “Active”, “Inactive” and “Passive” so that fast and effective collision detection can be performed. For the real force feedback, the hardnesss of some flower stems is measured with a durometer, and the flowers are sorted into three types: soft grass, hard grass and branch. An approximated equation, which calculates the force according to the flower type, is introduced based on the result of the mesurement. The measured datum, however, is a force that is generated when the stem of a flower contacts with one pin of a pinholder. Then the number of pins that contact with the stem should be calculated according to the radius of the stem, and the true force should be calculated by multiplying the measured force with the number of pins. Finally, the training system is consructed with a personal computer (PC) and a haptic device (see Fig. 1 (a)). By using the stick of the haptic device, users can grab a flower and insert it into a pinholder. They can feel the force feedback during inserting it into the pinholder and when the flower contacts with another one. Unless the flower is deeply enough inserted into the pinholder, the flower falls down so that the falling down simulation is necessary. The simulation image appears on the display of the PC (see Fig. 1 (b)). They can not only change the viewpoint but also make zooming in and out of the image at any time. As the result of some questionnaires to users, they can feel the force feedback and can train for the skill of flower arrangement by themselves without any real flowers.",Computer graphics | Flower arrangement | Training systems | Virtual reality,9,0,Not relevant

In this study, we examined NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) wires that were annealed into springs to develop an active, soft orthotic (ASO) for the knee. Actively controlled SMA springs may provide variable assistances depending on factors such as when, during the gait cycle, the springs are activated; ongoing muscle activity level; and needs of the wearer. Unlike a passive brace, an active orthotic may provide individualized control, assisting the muscles so that they may be used more appropriately, and possibly leading to a re-education of the neuro-motor system and eventual independence from the orthotic system. A prototype was tested on a suspended, robotic leg to simulate the swing phase of a typical gait. The total deflection generated by the orthotic depended on the knee angle and the total number of actuators triggered, with a max deflection of 35° While SMAwires have a high energy density, they require a significant amount of power. Furthermore, the loaded SMA spring response times were much longer than the natural frequency of an average gait for the power conditions tested.

For imaging, a 360 degree acquisition using cone beam geometry is used to acquire 500 projection images which are reconstructed to produce a high resolution ∼512 × 512 × 512 CT volume data set. In addition to the diagnostic imaging capabilities of the bCT scanner, the system appears to be an excellent platform for image guidance of interventional procedures such as robotic biopsy, radiofrequency ablation, and cryoablation. In addition to percutaneous procedures, the bCT system may also be an excellent platform for rotational beam radiation therapy. Computer simulations and physical phantom‐based experiments were used to define the dose distributions possible using the bCT system for radiation therapy. A number of beam energies from 120 kVp to 480 kVp were simulated. Initial results suggest that in addition to homogeneous dose distributions for treating the whole breast, that focused therapeutic approaches using collimators may be possible. The pendent position of the breast with the women prone is also thought to be a more reproducible approach to fractionated radiotherapy of the breast.

The use of surgical simulators outside of the operating room, in a low-stakes environment, has been shown to shorten such learning curves. We present a multidisciplinary validation study of a robotic surgery simulator, the da Vinci® Skills Simulator (dVSS). Trainees and attending faculty from the University of Toronto, Departments of Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynecology (ObGyn), were recruited to participate in this validation study. All participants completed seven different exercises on the dVSS (Camera Targeting 1, Peg Board 1, Peg Board 2, Ring Walk 2, Match Board 1, Thread the Rings, Suture Sponge 1) and, using the da Vinci S Robot (dVR), completed two standardized skill tasks (Ring Transfer, Needle Passing). Participants were categorized as novice robotic surgeon (NRS) and experienced robotic surgeon (ERS) based on the number of robotic cases performed. Statistical analysis was conducted using independent T test and non-parametric Spearman's correlation. A total of 53 participants were included in the study: 27 urology, 13 ObGyn, and 13 thoracic surgery (Table 1). Most participants (89 %) either had no prior console experience or had performed <10 robotic cases, while one (2 %) had performed 10-20 cases and five (9 %) had performed ≥20 robotic surgeries. The dVSS demonstrated excellent face and content validity and 97 and 86 % of participants agreed that it was useful for residency training and post-graduate training, respectively. The dVSS also demonstrated construct validity, with NRS performing significantly worse than ERS on most exercises with respect to overall score, time to completion, economy of motion, and errors (Table 2). Excellent concurrent validity was also demonstrated as dVSS scores for most exercises correlated with performance of the two standardized skill tasks using the dVR (Table 3). This multidisciplinary validation study of the dVSS provides excellent face, content, construct, and concurrent validity evidence, which supports its integrated use in a comprehensive robotic surgery training program, both as an educational tool and potentially as an assessment device. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.",Assessment | Robotic surgery | Surgical simulator | Training,13,0,Not relevant

In engineering departments, the target training hardware interfacing to these two types of devices is often duplicated in two different labs. This repetition of plant hardware can become expensive and space consuming with separate setups required for each controller. This paper discusses a novel instrumentation and control system training platform based around the use of both an embedded controller and a PLC wired to the same electromechanical plant. A supervisory controller electronically enables one of the two controllers to interface to peripheral devices and sensors. This allows an instructor to set up a trainer to be used in either a PLC class or an embedded systems class with the flick of a virtual switch. The setup could be used to control virtually any electromechanical system in an educational environment such as a small scale elevator simulator or a Cartesian robot for pick and place operation. Since the PLC and microcontroller are user operated using different programming languages, the setup provides a level of versatility through the capability to interact with two separate technologies on one independent system with no physical configuration changes necessary.

The user interface is very flexible, allowing instructors to post new problems by changing the problem descriptions and image files. The Design component includes two main steps: Process and Critical Path Method (CPM). This component facilitates activities related to conceptual design of a workcell. In the Process step, the user identifies and selects symbols corresponding to desired functions, then enters estimated costs and duration of each activity in a network. In the CPM step, the user can construct a CPM matrix of columns and rows to describe precedence relationships among activities. The system will automatically calculate cycle time for robotic workcell design activities. The Analysis component includes three main parts: Layout, Simulation, and Show Designs. Layout shows the recommended layout for user's final design in terms of the number of robot and conveyer systems. Simulation allows the analysis of part flow performance to facilitate assessment of the properties of the user's conceptual design. In addition, the user can see calculated values for cycle time, critical path, and total cost. In Show Designs, the user can review different layouts in terms of operation time and cost of each step, overall cycle time and total cost. The toolkit was evaluated by 27 undergraduate students who took a manufacturing automation and robotics course in Fall 2005. Students' comments and opinions were mostly positive and included suggestions for further improvement. Future directions include (1) adding an interactive tutorial component including a case study of designing an automated system; (2) testing the prototype with a larger student population; (3) soliciting input from industry experts; and (4) comparing and contrasting how similar problems are solved by experts and novices. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.",,1,0,Not relevant

Drawing and interpreting graphs play a key role in the understanding of science, while the lack of these has proved to be a handicap and a limiting factor in the learning of scientific concepts. It has been observed that despite the amount of previous graph-working experience, students of all ages experience a series of difficulties when trying to comprehend graphs or when trying to relate them with physical concepts such as position, velocity and acceleration. Several computational tools have risen to improve the students' understanding of kinematical graphs; however, these approaches fail to develop graph construction skills. On the other hand, Robots have opened new opportunities in learning. Nevertheless, most of their educational applications focus on Robotics related subjects, such as robot programming, robot construction, and artificial intelligence. This paper describes a robotic activity based on face-to-face computer supported collaborative learning. By means of a set of handhelds and a robot wirelessly interconnected, the aim of the activity is to develop graph construction and graph interpretation skills while also reinforcing kinematics concepts. Results show that students using the robotic activity achieve a significant increase in their graph interpreting skills. Moreover, when compared with a similar computer-simulated activity, it proved to be almost twice as effective.

There are limitations to the current commercially available system, and new robotic platforms, some designed to compete in the current market and some to address niche surgical considerations, are being developed that will change the robotic landscape in the next decade. Adoption of these new systems will be dependent on overcoming barriers to true telesurgery that range from legal to logistical. As additional surgical disciplines embrace robotics and open surgery continues to be replaced by robotic approaches, it will be imperative that adequate education and training keep pace with technology.

Unfortunately, delivering such hands-on laboratory experiences to all the students has become quite challenging, as most engineering schools have distance learning programs. If it is possible to handle laboratory training with ""virtual models"" of the equipment in the computer, it could offer tremendous advantage for the engineering technology distance students as they could operate costly laboratory equipment on their own computer and they can learn even while making mistakes. The paper presents an application of the virtual reality technology in order to improve the laboratory practices of engineering technology distance learning courses in the areas of industrial robotics and computer-aided manufacturing. A developed virtual reality software system, VCIMLAB has been utilized for this study. The results of the presented educational initiative, assessed through tests and feedback surveys, suggest that the virtual manufacturing laboratory is competitive in hands-on training for distance students as they can learn better the operations of robotics and manufacturing systems when realistic, interactive simulations are used instead of audio-video demonstrations.

Furthered by demographic change, new therapeutic concepts and techniques will emerge between conflicting demands of patients, surgeons and economists. Procedures with further reduced surgical invasiveness will become standard treatment options in various surgical disciplines. The required expertise will disseminate extensively and simulator-based training of minimally-invasive operations will become a prerequisite for young surgeons in the future. The reduction of surgical trauma will be paralleled by the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic means of treatment in earlier stages of disease. The migration of patients to other medical specialties such as interventional gastroenterology will be partly compensated by the increasing number of patients with malignant diseases that will become eligible for surgery by means of early disease detection. Cooperations between surgeons and other physicians, e. g. for performing rendez-vous-interventions, will strengthen the establishment of multidisciplinary departments. Due to demographic change, a variety of surgical domains such as colorectal surgery will undergo significant decline while other areas like hernia surgery and tumor surgery will increase. Morbid obesity and obesity-related health problems are currently regarded as one of the most important future domains of surgery. The role of morbid obesity for the future of surgery might however be overrated since the development of an improved pathophysiological understanding of the underlying causes of the disease might lead to effective therapeutic strategies and render bariatric surgery obsolete. New treatment concepts might partially replace surgery in other indications as well. Thyroid surgery in Europe, for instance, is expected to suffer significant decline similar to the present situation in North America. The incidence of colon cancer will most likely increase in the future; however, conservative and interventional treatment will become more and more important. Despite the expected reduction in gastric cancer due to effective pharmacological treatment options, early disease detection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy will lead to increasing numbers of cases eligible for curative surgical treatment. Besides the persistence and increase of minor abdominal surgery, e. g. hernia repair and cholecystectomy, multivisceral surgery and debulking will become increasingly more important. Further, a new and highly specialized field of complex minimally-invasive surgery will emerge. New technologies and synergistic application of existing technologies that comprise specialized functionality as well as universal application and interoperation will ensure the long-term sustainability of surgery. Besides the benefit of improved minimal-invasive technology, the surgical armamentarium will be further enhanced by the integration of sensor data and diagnostic information. Combining pre- and intraoperative imaging and diagnostics in realtime will enable surgical operation planning and navigation. These technologies will in turn provide the basis for robotic support systems in the operating room. Robotic assistance will be substantial for the progression of surgical precision, effectiveness and safety. The enhancement of diagnostic modalities and improved ergonomics are currently considered to be the most important foundation for future developments. Simulator technology and innovative educational approaches will allow for focused surgical training and help in attracting young talented doctors to surgery. At present, it can be considered evident that the surgical profession will be further split into highly specialised domains with few generalists and a great number of super-specialits. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",ergonomics | minimally-invasive | navigation | NOTES | robotics | sensor technology | surgery future,0,0,Not relevant

Traditionally, mannequins have been used for clinical skill training, but a mannequin is quite different from a real patient because they have no autonomous movement or conversational ability. This indicates that pre-clinical simulation education is inadequate. We have, therefore, developed a robot patient that can reproduce an authentic clinical situation for dental clinical training. The robot patient, designed as a full-body model with a height of 157cm, has eight degrees of freedom in the head and the ability to perform various autonomous movements. Moreover, saliva secretion and conversation with the trainee can be reproduced. We have introduced the robot patient into an objective structured clinical examination targeted at fifth-grade students in our dental school to evaluate their skills in cavity preparation, whilst considering the safety of the treatment. As a result, many of the students were able to deal appropriately with a patient's unexpected movement. Moreover, results of a questionnaire survey showed that almost all the students recognised the educational value of the robot patient especially for 'risk management', and they preferred the robot patient to traditional mannequins. Practical application of the robot patient in dental clinical education was evaluated through the experiences of the fifth-grade students, which showed the effectiveness of the robot patient in the dental field. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Objective structured clinical examination | Risk management | Robot patient | Simulation education,32,1,Not relevant

Microsoft Robotics Studio (MSRS) is a recent initiative in applying SOA to embedded systems and one of its key features is its 3-D simulation tool that allows applications to be simulated before deployment. This paper proposes an ontology-based service-oriented simulation framework with MSRS by adding a set of ontology systems, i.e., service ontology, workflow ontology, entity ontology, and environment ontology. These ontology systems store relevant information useful to compose simulation applications, and items stored also cross reference to each other to facilitate reusability and rapid application composition, This paper then provides a detailed case study on a popular robotic game Sumobot using MSRS to illustrate the key concepts and how they can support rapid simulation development.1The contents of this paper were developed under a grant from US Department of Defense and the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), US Department of Education.

A significant improvement can be achieved using virtual reality training stations with lifelike visual, acoustic, tactile, and kinesthetic feedback Particularly, when simulating procedures that require direct contact with the patient body, a realistic haptic simulation addressing tactile and kinesthetic senses can be essential for the acceptance of virtual simulation stations. A purely passive phantom may provide realistic haptic feedback, but its properties cannot be changed over time. This paper presents the haptic display of the Munich Knee Joint Simulator, which was developed to improve training and education of physical knee joint examinations. The haptic interface comprises a combination of passive phantom segments providing realistic tactile sensations, and strong actuators generating highly dynamic kinesthetic force feedback. A 3 degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator was developed in this study to drive the thigh prosthesis and one 6 DOF industrial robot was used to actuate the shank prosthesis. Both manipulators are driven by hybrid admittance-impedance controllers capable of simulating the complex dynamics of the thigh and the shank. Both actuators are equipped with a 6 DOF force torque sensor and they are virtually coupled by an analytical knee joint model. The proposed setup is capable of simulating a mechanical stiffness as high as 80 kN/m in the translatory DOF and simultaneously allows free motion in the rotatory DOF. Experimental tests of the simulator with orthopedic physicians proved the usability of the proposed concept. © 2006 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,4,0,Not relevant

The best arrangement is to have some real clients willing to spend time to provide their ideas of a target system through interviews and Q&A sessions. However, this arrangement cannot be scaled up as it demands too much resource. Second Life (SL), a well-known 3D online virtual world, not only applied its simulative and social networking capabilities on entertainment and leisure aspects, but also in the field of education. Starting from 2008, we have introduced SL into a software development student project with 2 courses involved, which are Human Computer Interface and Foundations of Database Systems, and this arrangement has been practiced for 3 times. The presence of SL acts as an online platform for students to access and acquire user requirements from staff (AI robots) of a virtual company, through a series of interviews, for system development. The roles of SL are twofold: to reduce the operational overheads in the project administration and to allow students to gain more hands-on experiences through working on a simulated real-life business cases. Hence, student could learn how to apply their knowledge and understand the software development process in the real business world. In this paper, we would like to report our experience and results of using SL in the software engineering student projects. With the help of the student feedbacks and comments on the application of SL, their learning experience as well as the student attitude towards this kind of innovation learning could be analyzed.

Until now, the vast majority of robots used in surgery, have serial structures. Due to the orientation parallel module, the structure is able to reduce the pressure exerted on the entrance point in the patient's abdominal wall. The parallel robot can also handle both a laparoscope as well an active instrument for different surgical procedures. The advantage of this parallel structure is that the geometric model has been obtained through an analytical approach. The kinematic modelling of a new parallel architecture, the inverse and direct geometric model and the inverse and direct kinematic models for velocities and accelerations are being determined. The paper will demonstrate that with this parallel structure, one can obtain the necessary workspace required for a minimally invasive operation.

,,Implementing problem-based learning projects to synthesize feedback controllers using matlab/simulink and students assesment,cp,University of Maryland Eastern Shore,Princess Anne,United States,"Sharma, Rajnish;Nagchaudhuri, Abhijit","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"In the quest for automatic control [1] to the real-world dynamical systems, meeting the requirements with strict design standards including ascertaining optimality throughout the phases of engineering, modeling and applications still need much more emphasis on teaching methods due to be revised and implemented. In order to customize a part of it in the engineering education, this paper attempts to present a novel approach of implementing problem-based learning projects in the class. In particular, to learn classical and modern control techniques and simulation, these types of projects can be introduced in the class projects of control systems, robotics and mechatronics courses offered to junior and senior level undergraduate students in mechanical, electrical and aerospace engineering. As in the literature, these type of activities mostly have been practiced and relied upon establishing a separate one or two credits laboratory course devoted to experiments on classical control methods and design, which certainly should be, however, it may not be offered all times as a co-requisite and this significantly causes a subtle gap to realize the practical importance of the subject while learning the theory first time. The primary objective of the paper is to introduce simultaneous need of ""project-based learning"" that is implementable and viable in the class for teaching the theory of automatic control techniques using real- Time simulation methods as SIMULINK, Ref. [13]. Technically, the projects' implementation indeed is intended to demonstrate the classical control methods first along with an idea of establishing a sound background on the programming methods using MATLAB and SIMULINK [13]. In view of modern engineering and technology, focusing on emerging needs for the subject's knowledge, the practical understanding of modern software tools is inevitably required to suitably fit it in for resolving the challenges in the research and studies. To start the project-based learning task on implementing the classical and new theoretical techniques embedded with high level applied mathematics, there are many well-known problems in engineering dynamics, control systems, aerospace structures, space services and observations that can subjectively be opened to undergraduate and graduate level classes existed in the engineering course curriculum. The main advantage of the problem-based learning project is to simultaneously enhance the students' creativity, interest and motivation to adapt active learning of the course material. This activity also helps the students realize the subject's practical advancements as, i) To many shortterm goals as performing well in the class and preparing for a culminating experience through senior design projects, ii) To the long- Term goals as joining industry, higher education and the research in many directed areas in guidance, navigation and control. To meet these learning objectives for the mentioned topics, especially in the field of aerospace engineering, some of the project problems are specifically considered for designing automatic control for flight systems. The proposed activity, especially to interested students for their culminating research/senior design projects in the area of controls, also acts as an excellent primer necessitated for understanding nonlinear feedback controller, e.g. A controller design such as working with statedependent Riccati equations that require to solve a system of coupled governing nonlinear differential equations using state-space modeling, LQ type design, and many other solution methods in nonlinear automatic control. As one of the main course activities, the novel part of this paper is to introduce an undergraduate level in-class project exercise of solving 2-3 extensive problems that requires developing MATLAB subroutines and SIMULINK modeling to present the method of solution and grasp the theoretical ideas in practice to use it for multifaceted analysis of the control problem given in its nonlinear version as a real-world problem.

While the Information Age has changed virtually every other facet of our life, the education of these healthcare professionals, both present and future, is largely mired in the 100-year-old apprenticeship model best exemplified by the phase ""see one, do one, teach one."" Continuing medical education is even less advanced. While the half-life of medical information is less than 5 years, the average physician practices 30 years and the average nurse 40 years. Moreover, as medical care has become increasingly complex, medical error has become a substantial problem. The current convulsive climate in academic health centers provides an opportunity to rethink the way medical education is delivered across a continuum of professional lifetimes. If this is well executed, it will truly make medical education better, safer, and cheaper, and provide real benefits to patient care, with instantaneous access to learning modules.

However, the cost of developing real robots and performing many experiments can be very high. On another hand, virtual robot simulators are very limited in terms of interaction between simulated robots and real people. Thus we propose using an enhanced human-robot interaction simulator SIGVerse that enables users to join the virtual world occupied by simulated robots through immersive user interface. In this paper,we describe a collaborative human-robot interaction task where a virtual human agent is controlled remotely by human subjects to interact with an automatic virtual robot with implemented artificial emotional reactions. Our project sets the first steps to explore the potential of using an enhanced human-robot interaction simulator to build socially interactive robots that can serve in educational, team building, and collaborative task solving applications.",human-robot collaboration | multimodal interaction | robot emotions | social robotics,4,0,Not relevant

The paper discusses the development and utilization of HILS specifically in the instruction of control and design aspects of on-site and remote robotics courses. A HIL simulator differs from computer simulation as it involves actual hardware and is not limited with the software representation of the system. The HIL architecture proposed in this study is a novel contribution to robotics education and is different from previous HIL structures for robotics, in that the developed test-bed involves the actual joint actuator and can be programmed to reflect actual dynamics affecting that particular joint in the given robotic structure. Two motors driven by high performance DSP boards are used for this purpose; one representing the joint actuator and the other used for the generation of all the torque components affecting that joint for the robot system in consideration. Thus, it is possible to evaluate the overall performance of the robot and its end-effector by combining the data from each simulated jointassociated dynamics pair. The wide range of kinematic configurations thus offered by the simple structure of HILS makes them an attractive, cost-effective solution for the problem of limited repertoire in robotics labs, giving the students the opportunity to experiment with 'open architecture robots' that are essential for a thorough education in robot control, but on the other hand are quite rare and may not be available in an average lab environment. Additionally, similar to its use in the robotics lab applications presented in this study, HILS can provide a comprehensive test environment prior to the implementation of new control strategies on the actual system, thereby ensuring the safe use and longevity of high-cost robots in on-site/remote labs. The proposed HIL architecture is combined with a client/server software configuration to allow students access to the test-bed. The results obtained from the remote control of a two-degres-of-freedom planar arm presented as a case study have motivated the utilization of the system as an efficient education and research tool for on-site and remote robotics laboratories. © 2006 TEMPUS Publications.",,15,0,Not relevant

This is mainly because a behavioural model of a nonexistent design artifact at conceptual level is the basis for behavioural simulation and resulting computational design support. Behavioural models are particularly important for top-down design of multidisciplinary products such as mechatronic systems. During the conceptual design of such systems, intended ""operational behavior"" of the artifact is described without any physical realization. As design stages become more concrete, operational behaviour can be refined so as to represent well defined mathematical descriptions of corresponding physical behaviors. In this study, a model for representing the intended operational behaviour of a nonexistent educational robot, namely a rabbit robot, is presented for conceptual design. The operational behaviour of the robot is defined as composed of states and state transitions independent of any physical embodiment. Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) and Petri Net formalism are used for the model.

However, we currently have no dental-specific simulation environment with advanced reproducibility for medical emergencies. Therefore, we used the robot patient in objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) for testing student competence in emergency management. This study aimed to evaluate student responses to medical emergencies in the dental setting. Material and Methods: We used 98 fifth-grade dental students at Showa University as subjects and implemented the OSCE task entitled 'Management of medical emergency using a robot patient'. Candidates were asked to manage an emergency situation immediately after local anaesthesia, with one robot patient configured to develop vasovagal syncope and the other to experience adrenaline hypersensitivity. A questionnaire on the educational value of the robot patient was completed after the examination. Results: Thirty-two per cent of students could not accurately count her pulse because of an inappropriate method. Moreover, 78% could not correctly attach either the tonometer or pulse oximetry to the patient. Accurate diagnoses were given by only 22% of students, with vasovagal syncope diagnosed by 33% and adrenaline hypersensitivity by 8%. From a questionnaire, 78% of students recognised the usefulness of the robot patient in medical emergency training. Conclusion: We found that student responses to the emergency situation were poor.

Thus far training for robotic techniques has been unstructured and the requirements are variable across various regions. Several projects are currently underway to develop a robotic surgery curriculum and are in various stages of validation. We aimed to outline the structures of available curricula, their process of development, validation status and current utilization. Methods: We undertook a literature review of papers including the MeSH terms ""Robotics"" and ""Education"". When we had an overview of curricula in development, we searched recent conference abstracts to gain up to date information. Results: The main curricula are the FRS, the FSRS, the Canadian BSTC and the ERUS initiative. They are in various stages of validation and offer a mixture of theoretical and practical training, using both physical and simulated models. Discussion: Whilst the FSRS is based on tasks on the RoSS virtual reality simulator, FRS and BSTC are designed for use on simulators and the robot itself. The ERUS curricula benefits from a combination of dry lab, wet lab and virtual reality components, which may allow skills to be more transferable to the OR as tasks are completed in several formats. Finally, the ERUS curricula includes the OR modular training programme as table assistant and console surgeon.

The region known as Florida's First Coast is one of the fastest growing in the nation and has received recent acclaim as a top location for new and emerging businesses and industries to relocate or expand. The importance of manufacturing to the economy is crucial. Every individual and industry depends on manufactured goods. This sector continues to account for 14% of US GDP and 11% of total US employment. One way to help expand the regional industrial base is to develop a shared resource support facility in the fields of manufacturing engineering and design. The first objective of MIP is to stimulate transformation of knowledge in design and manufacturing occurring in the academic domain to applied research and development in industry. This is accomplished with project-centered innovations developed using a shared manufacturing and design resource. The second objective of MIP is to develop partnerships with additional academic institutions with the common goal of producing students whose education satisfies the needs of the regional workforce with scientific and technological training with relevance to industry. This also includes a mentorship facet to attract and retain engineering students for the future. The third objective is to implement MIP for long-term sustainability of technology transfer and creation of high-technology jobs in the manufacturing engineering and design professions.

This welded volcanic tuff is neither highlands- or maria-like in composition, being at best only half-way between in FeO content, and is only typical of a 2-3 % by area of the lunar surface. Indeed, JSC-1A has the wrong mineralogy [e.g., it has no ilmenite, yet has been used for hydrogen reduction of ilmenite, as well as for as feedstock for several other oxygen-production and ISRU processes.] And largely because of the blessings of NASA in the production of JSC-1, similar lunar simulants have been effectively duplicated by other nations (e.g., China, Japan). The Minnesota Lunar Simulant (MLS-1) was a reasonable hi-Ti mare soil simulant in composition, yet has been abandoned by NASA. When NASA MSFC got into the lunar simulant business, lunar soil experts repeatedly advised that ""one size does not fit all"", meaning that each lunar soil simulant should only be used for very specific purposes. But the education of the engineering community has not been sufficient such that ""high-quality studies are still being performed on the wrong simulants"". Also, lunar soil simulants are being produced supposedly with certain properties, which are in reality definitely not proper lunar simulants For example, simulants with nanophase metallic Fe are far from being similar to lunar soils; JSC-1A made with nanophase Fe has an order of magnitude more nanophase magnetite than metallic Fe, so what good is this product? Indeed, most people questioned are not really sure what or why they are trying to simulate nanophase Fe: magnetic susceptibility? Dielectric properties? Toxicity? A review of the unique properties of lunar samples required for studies in engineering and applied sciences (exclusive of biology) is conducted here. This naturally leads to an evaluation of current simulants and the requirements for simulants that must accurately reflect all properties of lunar soils.

However, with the recent economic downturns companies across the globe have cut down on training, which have significantly impact available skills negatively. The emergence of robots as substitute for human on the production floor is revealing the increasing relevance of machine and human interactions. Such interactions requires highly skilled workforce with appropriate educational background. Companies must step-up training to remain (and maintain) competitive advantage in the global market; similarly, universities must seize the opportunity to enhance academic programs to build requisite skills in the workforce.

Indeed, minimal access surgery has become increasingly accepted by the surgical community, but the surgeon is faced with the necessity of following a specific training. Over the past two decades, advances in computer-assisted technology and telecommunications have deeply altered surgical education. The role of the traditional ""Professor of Surgery"" has been superseded by the quantity and quality of knowledge available not only in the media and on the Internet, but also in CD-ROMs, DVDs, stream videos, webcasts and telementoring. Nowadays, information and knowledge is readily accessible for all to find. What is more, the knowledge of highly skilled teachers is available worldwide thanks to the Internet and other multimedia technologies. As new perspectives are opening up on the surgical horizon, such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the need to apply new technologies to teaching and training as well as in daily clinical practice has become evident. This encapsulates multimedia, computer-assisted learning, videoconferencing, virtual reality and computer-assisted simulation in order to maximize surgical education. Telementoring through videoconferencing renders the acquisition of the cognitive aspects of surgical procedures easier through the observation of experts during hands-on practice.

In addition, a virtual reconstruction of the patient may also enhance diagnosis and enable a preoperative simulation and a preoperative training. Finally, the computerized data will allow the scheduling of automated surgical procedures. Robotics have demonstrated their ability in performing long-distance, remote-controlled surgical procedures. Surgeons require access to information whenever and wherever, and the Internet offers them that very chance, along with observation, training and education. Websites dedicated to surgery such as www.websurg.com incorporate all aspects of surgical training including fully illustrated and animated operative techniques, videos and experts' recommendations that, with the continuous updating of information, represent the future tool for the transfer of surgical and scientific knowledge. Using all these technologies, education may be improved through WeBSurg's virtual university as it gathers academic knowledge, education and expertise from around the world without any constraints of time and/or space. It will also facilitate the standardization of surgical treatments.",,1,0,Not relevant

MARS-OZ will provide a platform for a diverse range of Mars analogue research in Australia. The simulated base consists of two mobile modules whose dimensions and shape approximate those of horizontally landed bent biconic spacecraft described in an earlier paper. The modules are designed to support field engineering, robotics, architectural, geological, biological and human factors research at varying levels of simulation fidelity. Non-Mars related research can also be accommodated, for example general field geology and biology, and engineering research associated with sustainable, low impact architecture. Crews of up to eight can be accommodated. In addition to its research function, the base also will serve as a centre of space education and outreach activities. The prime site for the MARS-OZ simulated base is located in the northern Flinders Ranges near Arkaroola in South Australia. This region contains many features that provide useful scientific analogues to known or possible past and present conditions on Mars from both a geological and biological perspective. The features will provide a wealth of study opportunities for crews. The very diverse terrain and regolith materials will provide ideal opportunities to field trial a range of equipment, sensors and exploration strategies. If needed, the prime site can be secured from casual visitors, allowing research into human interaction in isolation. Despite its relative isolation, the site is readily accessible by road and air from major Australian centres. This paper provides description of the configuration, design and construction of the proposed facility, its interior layout, equipment and systems fitouts, a detailed cost estimate, and its deployment.

Robotics and telesurgery loom on the horizon, and the technology used to drive these advances has serendipitous side-effects for the education and training arena. The graphical and haptic interfaces used to provide remote feedback to the operator - by passing control to a computer - may be used to generate simulations of the operative environment that are useful for training candidates in surgical procedures. One additional advantage is that the metrics calculated inherently in the controlling software in order to run the simulation may be used to provide performance feedback to individual trainees and mentors. New interfaces will be required to undergo evaluation of the simulation fidelity before being deemed acceptable. The potential benefits fall into one of two general categories: those benefits related to skill acquisition, and those related to skill assessment. The educational value of the simulation will require assessment, and comparison to currently available methods of training in any given procedure. It is also necessary to determine - by repeated trials - whether a given simulation actually measures the performance parameters it purports to measure.

Therefore, an objective and quantitative assessment tool is highly required in MIS, which can be used for determining surgeon's skills, evaluating educational programs and providing subjects with unbiased feedback. The goal of this paper is to review various assessment methods, summarize capabilities of the methods, and suggest future possible improvements. Specifically, this paper categorize existing methods into two groups: the first and the most well known group focuses on the analysis of surgical motions, and the other group uses force and torque as a key metric. Specifically, motion analysis includes tracking the body, tool, or hand motions of a surgeon, either from teleoperated robotic systems or surgical simulators using different sensors like wireless or electromagnetic motion tracking sensors, videoglove- based input devices, optical tracking system, or magnetic tracking technologies. Sometimes data explored form this method is synchronized with eye-gaze data (what a surgeon looks at while operating), or videographic data. Using motion analysis actually the number of movements, rate of movements, total path length, movement variability, time taken to complete the operation, average or peak velocity are considered for assessing surgical skills. On the other hand, the methods in the second group assess the skills based on force and toque data that surgeons apply through surgical instruments. More specifically, these methods use different kind of sensors placed on the grasper. Different force and torque measurement systems, hidden-Markov-model-based analysis, simulated models with criteria, and Virtual reality have been developed, allowing for the quantification of the performance of surgeons. Although, each method has its own advantageous, and according to the kind of surgical task and evaluation, these methods can be used successfully to assess surgical skills, to provide predictive validity for each of these methods more study is needed. Also, future works should improve the efficiency of each method and move toward automated, lowcost and real time assessment methods. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.",,0,0,Not relevant

To quickly realize new applications at low costs, the reuse of existing functionality is of high importance. In the area of mobile robotics, physics based simulation components promise optimal reusability: The physical laws always stay the same and do not depend on the application. Hence, as long as the applications try to emulate reality, physics based simulation software will be reusable. Unfortunately, depending on the kind of application, different simulation models for different physical domains are needed: Particle models for fluids and soil, finite-elements for non-rigid bodies, multi-body systems and so on. However, for those applications developed at Institute for Man-Machine Interaction at the RWTH Aachen University, a multi-body dynamics component has taken a central role in the process of application development. It is fully integrated within a modern 3D-simulation and visualization tool. It is enhanced by generalized tools of contact graph analysis, which support the fast development of robust applications suitable for daily use. The paper discusses the benefit of this multi-body system as a platform for versatile application development, taking the following three applications as examples: The first example is the development of forest machine simulators for usage in education and training of machine operators. The existence of a purely kinematically realized, phenomenological implementation with widely equivalent range of functions allows a direct comparison of the programming efforts. The second example is the development of algorithms for space robot motion planning. The example demonstrates, how easy and effective innovative robotic simulation applications can be realized using a common, dynamics based simulation framework.

Multiple methods and techniques are used by engineering educators to help students gain familiarity and interest in robotic systems and their applications. However, very rarely the students get the opportunity to gain the ultimate experience of applying acquired knowledge of the field through building an actual robot. This is because building a robot during a college course involves multiple challenges including robotic systems high complexity and the requirement of combining multiple knowledge bases. Students studying robotics end up, at the most, programming purchased robots, or simulating robots using software, but not actually going through the realities and challenges of putting the system together and making it functional to the point of experimenting with it. In this paper, a unique experience in learning robotic systems and building actual robots is presented. This experience is made available in an elective course on robotic systems engineering at Grand Valley State University (GVSU), School of Engineering (SOE). The produced robots are two or three jointed arm configuration robots, controlled by a programmable microcontroller and built based on classroom gained knowledge. In the classroom, the students learn the kinematics and simplified dynamics of robots, as well as other related topics. In the laboratory, the students are required to apply the learned concepts of kinematics and design in combination with control systems to build a robot that will help them understand and demonstrate these concepts. The course final projects include robotic systems that are built or integrated by teams of students. These projects provide a range of challenges that extends from mechanical design to control systems. The projects are taken up by teams of students having diversified interests and skill bases within the course. The final outcomes of the course are working robotic systems that can demonstrate the students' knowledge and interest, which the students use significantly as a proof of their competence level when putting together their resumes to move into the next level of their careers.

The complex interactions of agents in a team as well as with other agents make it extremely difficult for human developers to understand and analyze agent-team behavior. It has thus become increasingly important to develop tools that can help humans analyze, evaluate, and understand team behaviors. However, the problem of automated team analysis is largely unaddressed in previous work. In this article, we identify several key constraints faced by team analysts. Most fundamentally, multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. In addition, effective ways of presenting the analysis to humans is critical and the presentation techniques depend on the model being presented. Finally, analysis should be independent of underlying team architecture and implementation. We also demonstrate an approach to addressing these constraints by building an automated team analyst called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis. ISAAC acquires multiple, heterogeneous team models via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. ISAAC also provides feedback on team improvement in two novel ways: (i) It supports principled ""what-if"" reasoning about possible agent improvements; (ii) It allows the user to compare different teams based on their patterns of interactions. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in two domains: (i) RoboCup Soccer; (ii) software agent teams participating in a simulated evacuation scenario. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup '99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup Scientific Challenge Award.

During medical education and training, several methods will be put to use such as watching video, reading books, making use of the simulated patient (SP), and so on. These can help medical staffs, especially novices, to master the skills and accumulate experiences. To make up for the drawbacks of the above methods, such as lack of active interactions, limitation of multi-symptom reproductions, etc, the medical training simulators have been developed to improve training effectiveness. However, most of these simulators only mimic the symptoms. They have no the abilities to show the pathology of diseases. This limits the training effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an elbow robot named WKE-1(Waseda Kyotokagaku Elbow Robot No.1) for neurologic examination training as one part of the whole body patient robot named WKP (Waseda Kyotokagaku Patient). In this robot, we simulate various symptoms occurring during the examination of elbow force, biceps tendon reflex, involuntary action, and also make a physiological neurological model to simulate the pathology of the nervous system. Taking advantage of this robot, the trainee can get a systematic training on both the skills and knowledge. Finally, we take a set of experiments to verify our proposed mechanism and system. The experimental results lead to the consideration that the approach is worth following in further research. © 2013 IEEE.",,12,0,Not relevant

Eric",Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery,Journal,"Objective: To develop and validate a new ureteral anastomosis simulation model. Methods: We designed a training model to simulate the task of ureteral anastomosis required for ureteroneocystostomy that is suitable for robotic and laparoscopic approaches. Face validity was measured using questions related to surgical authenticity and educational value of the model. Construct validity was measured by comparing scores using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills Scale (GOALS) scale between ''procedure experts,'' ''robotic experts,'' and ''trainees'' groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences in the scores and operating times between the 3 groups. Associations between previous surgical experience and performance scores were measured using the Spearman rho correlation coefficient. Results: Four urologists experienced with robotically assisted ureteroneocystostomies were included in the procedure experts group. The robotic experts group consisted of 5 gynecologists experienced in robotic surgery. The trainees group consisted of 12 urology and gynecology upper-level residents and fellows. All experts agreed or strongly agreed that the model was authentic to the live procedure and a useful training tool. Mean (SD) total GOALS scores were significantly better for the procedure experts group compared to the robotic experts group and to the trainees group (P=0.02 vs P=0.004, respectively). The robotic experts group's GOALS scores were also significantly higher than that of the trainees group (P=0.05). There were no differences in mean times required to complete the procedure. Surgical experience moderately correlated with scores on all 3 assessment scales. Conclusions: Superior performance on the model by more experienced surgeons demonstrates evidence of construct validity. This authenticand useful model allows surgeons to learn and practice the ureteral anastomosis portion of the ureteral reimplantation surgeries before operating on a live patient.

Background: The acquisition of surgical skills may be challenging for novel techniques and/or those with prolonged learning curves. Methods: Randomized controlled trial involving 41 resident physicians performing the Tubes (Da Vinci Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) simulator exercise with versus without peer feedback of video-recorded performance through a social networking Web page. Data collected included simulator exercise score, time to completion, and comfort and satisfaction with robotic surgery simulation. Results: There were no baseline differences between the intervention group (n = 20) and controls (n = 21). The intervention group showed improvement in mean scores from session 1 to sessions 2 and 3 (60.7 vs 75.5, P < 0.001, and 60.7 vs 80.1, P < 0.001, respectively).

Three standardized, validated training methods were used: (i) structured inanimate tasks; (ii) virtual reality exercises on the da Vinci Skills Simulator (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA); and (iii) a standardized robotic surgical task in a live porcine model with performance graded by the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) tool. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate performance differences between novices and experts (construct validity). Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ) was used to measure the association of performance across inanimate, simulation and in vivo methods (cross-method validity). Results Novice and expert surgeons had previously performed a median (range) of 0 (0-20) and 300 (30-2000) robotic cases, respectively (P < 0.001). Construct validity: experts consistently outperformed residents with all three methods (P < 0.001). Cross-method validity: overall performance of inanimate tasks significantly correlated with virtual reality robotic performance (ρ = -0.7, P < 0.001) and in vivo robotic performance based on GEARS (ρ = -0.8, P < 0.0001). Virtual reality performance and in vivo tissue performance were also found to be strongly correlated (ρ = 0.6, P < 0.001).

Yet no consensus exists regarding what a core skill set comprises or how to measure skill performance. Defining a core skill set and relevant metrics would help surgical educators evaluate different simulators. Approach: This review draws from published research to propose a core technical skill set for using the da Vinci surgeon console. Publications on three commercial simulators were used to evaluate the simulators’ content addressing these skills and associated metrics. Findings: An analysis of published research suggests that a core technical skill set for operating the surgeon console includes bimanual wristed manipulation, camera control, master clutching to manage hand position, use of third instrument arm, activating energy sources, appropriate depth perception, and awareness of forces applied by instruments. Validity studies of three commercial virtual reality simulators for robot-assisted surgery suggest that all three have comparable content and metrics. However, none have comprehensive content and metrics for all core skills. Insights: Virtual reality simulation remains a promising tool to support skill training for robot-assisted surgery, yet existing commercial simulator content is inadequate for performing and assessing a comprehensive basic skill set. The results of this evaluation help identify opportunities and challenges that exist for future developments in virtual reality simulation for robot-assisted surgery.

In addition to its research and development mission, PISCES will function as an education and training center for astronauts, scientists, K-12 and university students, and a public outreach resource for local residents and tourists to experience the multitude of scientific, educational and economic benefits that space exploration will bring to Hawai'i, the United States and, indeed, all of humankind. PISCES will further space exploration in response to Congress's call for ground-based analog facilities in Public Law 109-155 (2005), and will position Hawai'i as a major player in the coming space exploration era. It will benefit the people of Hawai'i by creating new jobs and enhancing the State's educational institutions. PISCES is administratively based in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at Hilo. Laboratories and field operations will be located on the Big Island of Hawai'i, taking advantage of volcanic soil and crater-filled terrain similar to that found on the Moon. This paper describes the PISCES development plans, particularly in the areas of In-Situ Resource Utilization, Robotics and Education and Outreach.",,4,0,Not relevant

Some studies show that there is a lack of people able to plan the introduction of these equipments in manufacturing environments and to operate them after its inception, leading to the need to train undergraduates in the operation and programming of industrial robots. Due to the Portuguese economic situation, there is a lack of funding for the Higher Education Institutions, leading to the need of finding innovative ways to teach these subjects. Bearing these ideas in mind, ISEP began teaching a course on Industrial Robotics based in the achievement of the practical training using ABB RobotStudio (from ABB Robotics) robot simulation software for off-line programming. This paper describes the main results of such experience and the evaluation of the course made by the students who have attended this course.

""However, students learn more and get more engaged in a project oriented learning environment.""16 For this reason the course has been completely restructured to include a practical design project as opposed to only simulations that will enable the students to directly apply the knowledge that they have gained from the course. This experience ""will enable the students to gain a greater understanding of the material given a project that will engage them in the design activity.""16 The course has been designated a Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP) course by Texas A&M University - Kingsville due to its restructured format including more student engagement. In this restructured course, the sensors and controls were developed by four design teams for a small six-legged robot. The student teams assessed the problem and developed one or more solutions. The class used an industry approach to the design. Each team was lead by a team leader. These lead personnel, students, in turn, were responsible to the overall project manager, another student in the class. The students together chose the best design alternative under the constraints, such as scheduling, power, space, costs, and available resources. Each team designed and tested one or more subsystems. These systems were next integrated into the full system. The design teams, thus, gained a better understanding of practical design considerations and integration as well as project management. The students tested the functional ability of the robot in the laboratory after subsystem integration. The success of the hands-on practical design approach in the microprocessor based control class is clearly demonstrated by student satisfaction, presentations, reports, and overall achievement in the course. The new redesigned course allowed more realistic practical industry based design concepts to be adopted together with more active student engagement. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.",,3,0,Not relevant

The increased reliance on simulation classrooms has proven successful in learning skills. Questions persist concerning the ability of technology-driven robotic devices to form and cultivate caring behaviors, or sufficiently develop interactive nurse-client communication necessary in the context of nursing. METHODS. This article examines the disconnects created by use of simulation technology in nursing education, raising the question: ""Can learning of caring-as-being, be facilitated in simulation classrooms?"" FINDINGS. We propose that unless time is spent with human beings in the earliest stages of nursing education, transpersonal caring relationships do not have space to develop. Learning, crafting, and maturation of caring behaviors threatens to become a serendipitous event or is no longer perceived as an essential characteristic of nursing. CONCLUSIONS. Technology does not negate caring-the isolation it fosters makes transpersonal caring all the more important.

The use of scenario-based learning incorporates problem-based learning whilst encouraging students to collaborate with their colleagues and dynamically adapt to their environment. This increased interaction stimulates a deeper understanding and the generation of new knowledge. The Victorian Space Science Education Centre (VSSEC) uses scenario-based learning in its Mission to Mars, Mission to the Orbiting Space Laboratory and Primary Expedition to the M.A.R.S. Base programs. These programs utilize methodologies such as hands-on applications, immersive-learning, integrated technologies, critical thinking and mentoring to engage students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and highlight potential career paths in science and engineering. The immersive nature of the programs demands specialist environments such as a simulated Mars environment, Mission Control and Space Laboratory, thus restricting these programs to a physical location and limiting student access to the programs. To move beyond these limitations, VSSEC worked with its university partners to develop a web-based mission that delivered the benefits of scenario-based learning within a school environment. The Robotic Mission to Mars allows students to remotely control a real rover, developed by the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR), on the VSSEC Mars surface. After completing a pre-mission training program and site selection activity, students take on the roles of scientists and engineers in Mission Control to complete a mission and collect data for further analysis. Mission Control is established using software developed by the ACRI Games Technology Lab at La Trobe University using the principles of serious gaming. The software allows students to control the rover, monitor its systems and collect scientific data for analysis. This program encourages students to work scientifically and explores the interaction between scientists and engineers.

10.1108/01439910610705608,,Remote programming over multiple heterogeneous robots: A case study on distributed multirobot architecture,ar,Universidad Jaume I,Castellon de la Plana,Spain,"Wirz, Raul;Marin, Raul;Sanz, Pedro J.",Industrial Robot,Journal,"Purpose - The authors of this paper aim to describe the design of distributed architectures for the remote control of multirobot systems. A very good example of remote robot programming in order to validate these architectures is in fact the remote visual servoing control. It uses sequences of camera inputs in order to bring the robots to the desired position, in an iterative way. In fact, in this paper, we enabled the students and scientists in our university to experiment with their remote visual servoing algorithms through a remote real environment instead of using simulation tools. Design/methodology/approach - Since 2001, the authors have been using the UJI-TeleLab as a tool to allow students and scientists to program remotely several vision-based network robots. During this period it has been learnt that multithread remote programming combined with a distributed multirobot architecture, as well as advanced multimedia user interfaces, are very convenient, flexible and profitable for the design of a Tele-Laboratory. The distributed system architecture permits any external algorithm to have access to almost every feature of several network robots. Findings - Presents the multirobot system architecture and its performance by programming two closed loop experiments using the Internet as communication media between the user algorithm and the remote robots (i.e. remote visual servoing). They show which conditions of Internet latencies and bandwidth are appropriate for the visual servoing loop. We must take into account that the real images are taken from the remote robot scenario and the experiment algorithm is executed from the client side at the user place. Moreover, the distributed multirobot architecture is validated by performing a multirobot programming example using two manipulators and a mobile robot. Research limitations/implications - Future work will pursue the development of more sophisticated visual servoing loops using external cameras, pan/tilt and also stereo cameras. Indeed, the stereo cameras control introduces an interesting difficulty related to their synchronization during the loop, which introduces the need to implement Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) based camera monitoring. By using camera servers that support RTSP (e.g. Helix Producer, etc.) it means sending the differences between the frames instead of sending the whole frame information for every iteration. Practical implications - The distributed multirobot architecture has been validated since 2003 within the education and training scenario. Students and researchers are able to use the system as a tool to rapidly implement complex algorithms in a simple manner. The distributed multirobot architecture is being applied as well within the industrial robotics area in order to program remotely two synchonized robots. Originality/value - This paper is an original contribution to the network robots field, since it presents a generic architecture to program remotelly a set of heterogeneous robots.

Objective metrics are required to adequately assess robotic surgical skills and yet surrogates for proficiency, such as economy of motion and tool path metrics, are not readily accessible directly from the da Vinci® robot system. The trakSTAR™ Tool Tip Tracker is a widely available, cost-effective electromagnetic position sensing mechanism by which objective proficiency metrics can be quantified. We validated a robotic surgery curriculum using the trakSTAR device to objectively capture robotic task proficiency metrics. Materials and Methods: Through an institutional review board approved study 10 subjects were recruited from 2 surgical experience groups (novice and experienced). All subjects completed 3 technical skills modules, including block transfer, intracorporeal suturing/knot tying (fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery) and ring tower transfer, using the da Vinci robot with the trakSTAR device affixed to the robotic instruments. Recorded objective metrics included task time and path length, which were used to calculate economy of motion. Student t test statistics were performed using STATA®. Results: The novice and experienced groups consisted of 5 subjects each. The experienced group outperformed the novice group in all 3 tasks. Experienced surgeons described the simulator platform as useful for training and agreed with incorporating it into a residency curriculum. Conclusions: Robotic surgery curricula can be validated by an off-the-shelf instrument tracking system.

Ballentine;Allaf, Mohamad;Kim, Jongwon;Stoianovici, Dan",Journal of Urology,Journal,"Purpose: Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy results rely on physician ability to target the gland according to the biopsy schema. However, to our knowledge it is unknown how accurately the freehand, transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy cores are placed in the prostate and how the geometric distribution of biopsy cores may affect the prostate cancer detection rate. Materials and Methods: To determine the geometric distribution of cores, we developed a biopsy simulation system with pelvic mock-ups and an optical tracking system. Mock-ups were biopsied in a freehand manner by 5 urologists and by our transrectal ultrasound robot, which can support and move the transrectal ultrasound probe. We compared 1) targeting errors, 2) the accuracy and precision of repeat biopsies, and 3) the estimated significant prostate cancer (0.5 cm3 or greater) detection rate using a probability based model. Results: Urologists biopsied cores in clustered patterns and under sampled a significant portion of the prostate. The robot closely followed the predefined biopsy schema. The mean targeting error of the urologists and the robot was 9.0 and 1.0 mm, respectively. Robotic assistance significantly decreased repeat biopsy errors with improved accuracy and precision. The mean significant prostate cancer detection rate of the urologists and the robot was 36% and 43%, respectively (p <0.0001). Conclusions: Systematic biopsy with freehand transrectal ultrasound guidance does not closely follow the sextant schema and may result in suboptimal sampling and cancer detection. Repeat freehand biopsy of the same target is challenging. Robotic assistance with optimized biopsy schemas can potentially improve targeting, precision and accuracy. A clinical trial is needed to confirm the additional benefits of robotic assistance. © 2012 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",biopsy | prostate | prostatic neoplasms | robotics | ultrasonography,41,0,Not relevant

These find application in entertainment, education, scientific visualization, ergonomic evaluation and as a medium for artistic expression. Two of the principal objectives which need to be addressed if human figure animation is to become more practical are the convenient, high level specification of movement sequences and the production of truly realistic movement. In order to provide convenient means of specifying movements there has been a tendency away from cell animation, where the user defines key positions in time, toward higher levels of control, where movements are specified as tasks like “walk to the door”. The computer “knows” about these tasks, decomposes them and calculates the proper joint angles over time. To attain a greater degree of motion realism techniques from robotics and biomechanics are being applied, where movements are generated through forces acting on masses of bodies. This paper introduces a method to animate human locomotion based on these principles. A generic locomotion cycle is derived from a simple dynamic model. The forces and torques which control this model are internally generated from knowledge about human gait. The mechanical and robot-like appearance of the simulated motion is visually enhanced and humanized through kinematic algorithms; a human leg is superimposed onto the simplified dynamic pendulum leg, a pelvis is induced and the arm swing and shoulder rotation during locomotion are expressed as functions of the lower body movements. The system which has been implemented can produce quite realistic looking human walks under a fairly wide range of conditions upon specification of only a few parameters, such as desired walking speed and step length. This will be extended in a straightforward way to running and locomotion over uneven terrain, up and down stairs, etc. Studies are also underway to determine how this approach can be applied to non-locomotory movement. © 1991, Elsevier Inc.

Within human factors, four topics accounted for the increases: advanced (computer) controls and displays; speech (voice) recognition & synthesis; AI, expert systems & robotics; and computer-based maintenance & troubleshooting aids. No similar trends are evident in defence R&D. In terms of types of TPST R&D, defence and industry have about the same proportion of effort in development (i.e., application to a potential new product or service).

,,The use of hardware emulation systems for control systems research and education,ar,University of Washington,Seattle,United States,"Vagners, Juris",Advances in the Astronautical Sciences,Conference Proceeding,"Research in controls in a University setting has always been a balancing act between purely theoretical research (including that supported by simulation) and applied research which includes hardware laboratories. Use of hardware systems is typically restricted due to the high cost of such systems, both in purchase as well as in maintenance. The cost is prohibitive if one wishes to construct examples of actual systems, such as space structures, robotic manipulators, or impossible, as would be the case for atmospheric flight vehicles. The situation is exacerbated when we look at educational activities in controls. The net result is that both research and education depend heavily on simulation to bring the ""applied"" flavor, a task simplified by the availability of computer aided control design (CACD) packages such as the MATLAB and MATRIXx family of codes. At the University of Washington we have been experimenting with the use of simpler electromechanical devices as ""hardware emulators"" of the actual systems. One of the guiding principles for selection of devices or systems is that they embody key dynamic response properties that duplicate those expected in a full scale system. For example, such properties include open loop instability, nonminimum phase behavior, significant friction/stiction phenomena, structural flexibility, dead zones and backlash. Another principle is that these systems should have potential for easy modification to bring in new features. Yet another is that that systems should be rcalistic ""test beds"" for investigation of a wide range of current research issues If the devices are to fulfill the needs of research as well as education, it should be possible to have fairly elementary configurations requiring application of standard control concepts, while allowing the introduction of features that ; require the most advanced techniques for successful control system function. In this paper, several examples of such systems are discussed that are currently in use at the University of Washington.",,0,0,Not relevant
,,Robo-Billiards: A game to understand adaptive behavior of middle school students,cp,University of South Alabama,Mobile,United States,"Brown, Kurt;Doran, Michael;Langan, David;Thoma, Tom","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"Robo-Billiards is a timed competition in which middle school students remotely control robots to place billiards balls in pockets. Points are awarded in the game based on how the balls are combined in the pockets. If a ball is accidently knocked off the game surface it is out of play and the opportunity for the overall maximum score is lost. It was observed that once a ball was knocked off the surface, creating a fault, that students tended to panic and seldom adjusted their strategy to achieve the maximum score with the remaining billiard balls. The capability to adapt in real-time is what makes humans successful in chaotic environments. In order for computer systems to be successful, they too must adapt in real-time to unplanned events. Two problems for adaptive systems are how to represent knowledge and how to use that knowledge to make adaptive decisions. With this research we examined the use of scripts (that specified robot ball selection and placement) to represent knowledge, and heuristics and dynamic scripting to make adaptive decisions. In this research, an Autonomous Robo-Billiards Opponent (ARBO) was developed to play Robo-Billiards. As a baseline, ARBO was tested to determine if it could execute a script in less than five minutes and still earn the maximum score. Then faults were simulated while ARBO was executing a script to test if the system could adapt and earn the optimal score with the remaining balls. A potential use of this system is to compete against middle school students. Two immediate benefits would be to: (i) stimulate interest in STEM disciplines and (ii) demonstrate adaptive behavior when a fault occurs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.",,0,0,Not relevant

From a largely dominant industrial focus, robotics has undergone, by the turn of the new millennium, a major transformation in scope and dimensions. This expansion has been brought about by the maturity of the field and the advances in its related technologies to address the pressing needs for human-centered robotic applications. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives, in homes, workplaces, and communities, providing support in services, entertainment, education, manufacturing, personal health care, and assistance. The successful introduction of robots in human environments will rely on the development of competent and practical systems that are dependable, safe, and easy to use. This presentation focuses on the efforts to develop human-friendly robotic systems that combine the essential characteristics of safety, human-compatibility, and performance with emphasis on (i) new design concepts and novel sensing modalities; (ii) efficient planning and whole-body robot control strategies; and (iii) robotic-based synthesis of human motion and skills. In human-friendly robot design, our effort has focused on the development of intrinsically safe robotic systems that possess the requisite capabilities and performance to interact and work with humans. The novel design concept was based on a hybrid actuation approach that consists of biomimetic pneumatic muscles combined with small electric motors. The flexible muscles and the lightweight mechanism allow for human safety, while the electric motors compensate for the slower dynamics and nonlinearities of the pneumatics. This concept was shown to significantly decrease the inherent danger of robotic manipulators, as measured in terms of the reflected mass perceived at the point of impact. Safety can be further enhanced by the addition of robot skin to provide impact reduction and tactile sensing capabilities for advanced sensor based behaviors. Redundancy is a major challenge in the planning and control of humanoid robots. Inspired by human behaviors, our early work in robot control encoded tasks and diverse constraints into artificial potential fields capturing human-like goal-driven behaviors. To implement such behaviors on robots with complex human-like structures we developed a unified whole-body task-oriented control structure that addresses dynamics in the context of multiple tasks, multi-point contacts, and multiple constraints. The performance and effectiveness of this approach have been demonstrated through extensive robot dynamic simulations and implementations on physical robots for experimental validation. The new framework provides a multi-task prioritized control architecture allowing the simultaneous execution of multiple objectives in a hierarchical manner, analogous to natural human motion. Initially motivated by the development of human-like skills in robotics, our extensive study of human musculoskeletal system has brought insights and results that proved extremely valuable in human biomechanics. Understanding human motion is a complex procedure that requires accurate reconstruction of movement sequences, modeling of musculoskeletal kinematics, dynamics, and actuation, and suitable criteria for the characterization of performance. These issues have much in common with the problems of articulated body systems studied in robotics research. Building on methodologies and techniques developed in robotics, a host of new effective tools have been established for the synthesis of human motion.

The course was designed to enhance their interest in engineering and math, while providing a social context of empowerment, competition and cooperation. This paper will document our past and planned efforts to integrate robotics into high school math curriculum. Our goal is to build low-cost robots that can be purchased or built incrementally to manage budgetary restrictions. These robots should be reliable, robust, and most important of all, be customizable for the specific needs of the teacher and the student teams. Furthermore, we integrated the robots into math lessons. The results indicate that students in our robotics program benefited from the use of robots. We looked at a problem that students solved using the Pythagorean Theorem and then analyzed the results of the robotic simulation. The students correctly interpreted both the mathematical problem and the real world error that was produced when using the robots. Students were also able to understand the difference between conceptual error and real world error. The students recognized that the robots they built could be used as an instructional tool to a wider range of audience. In all, these clinical interviews explicitly show how students used the robotic art approach to better conceptualize and solve math problems. We also examined the two-boat problem that we intend to use in our future robotics math classroom. The problem is visually and dynamically solved. Successive approximation is used to identify a trend and come close to a solution. Using robots, students can guess and check to make sense of the problem then look at it from different angles and solve it in many ways. Students need to explore different estimates and evaluate each one until they come close to the solution. After examining the problem from so many different perspectives, they are now comfortable that the result they have gotten with the robots is near to the mathematically correct solution. Students can stop with the robotic investigation at any point and solve the problem algebraically. Learning mathematics with robots helps students visualize challenging real world applications and supports multiple representations of a problem. While students apply their knowledge of math concepts solving real world problems with the help of robots, they develop a lasting handson experience in a social context and a better attitude towards math education. Building low cost robots that schools can afford would ensure access, availability and foster mainstream instruction with robots that would help prepare our next generation in math and engineering principles. © American Society of Engeneering Education, 2013.",,4,0,Not relevant

The shepherding problem has many important and practical applications in security, environmental protection, agriculture, education and more. While much research has focused on simulating coordinated group behaviors, the shepherding problem has not received as much attention as it should be. This work investigate the possibility of addressing the shepherding problem using motion planning strategies. From an algorithmic point of view, the shepherding problem is extremely challenging due to its extremely large state space. It is clear that the existing motion planning methods cannot provide an efficient way to solve the problem. Instead, we propose an approach that incorporates computer-human interaction techniques with algorithmic robotics: an interactive motion planning method. In our experimental results, we have shown that this combination indeed provides performance improvement over the human-only and the computer-only approach. Although the proposed work shows promising initial results from our first prototype system, there are still a long way to go before we can have a better understanding of the interactive method for motion planning and the shepherding problem.

We compared the training programs and the results of traditional and simulation techniques, defined the concept of quasi physiology and propedeutics of robots and simulators, the role of clinical scenarios and reliability of robots of 6th level of realism in the formation of pathogenic environment for simulation training.

W.",Oceans Conference Record (IEEE),Conference Proceeding,"Since its founding in 2003, the MIT ROV Team has been participating in the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center's International ROV Competition. This year's challenges, in recognition of the International Polar Year, include operations in environments made to resemble those found in the Polar Regions. This includes working in currents, under ice sheets and in simulated open ocean environments. The three missions, each approximately 15 minutes long and in depths of up to 20 feet, include recovery and deployment of science packages and related support structures, the collection of faunal samples and repair and maintenance work at stations under water. In keeping with its vision to look beyond the competition and push the envelope, the MIT ROV Team built on the lessons learnt during the design, construction and operation of its fourth generation ROV, MTHR1, to design MIT ROV 5.0, a compact, powerful, highly maneuverable and modular robot capable of not only participating in the competition, but also performing a variety of tasks in the open environment. MIT ROV 5.0 was primarily designed to be an exploration robot meant to operate in sheltered waters, that is, with currents below one knot, lack of powerful localized turbulent flow and the absence of highly corrosive materials. The major design requirements included ease of operation, including setup, maintenance, dives and recovery, modularity, to allow quick reconfiguration to suit a variety of missions, robustness, so that it would stand up to the rigors of the open environment, small size, for greater maneuverability and low cost, for ease of reproduction. We came up with a robot that was slightly bigger than MTHR, with two modular payload bays with standard connectors that could accommodate mission-specific packages. The control box contains custom designed PC-104 size circuit boards that can support a number of different actuators and thrusters and adequate space for NiMH or LiON battery packs, which can both be used. Each board can be switched easily due to extensive use of standard sizes and connection interfaces. The frame uses high strength ABS plastic side plates with LEXAN cross-struts. The tether is a single strand Kevlar-jacketed fiberoptic cable with a Kevlar support string for added security. This tether can be replaced by a regular Ethernet or CAT-V cable is the need arises. Thus the vehicle is truly modular in every way. The MIT ROV 5.0 system as designed is very easy to use. The control software can be run off virtually any computer, using the keyboard or a standard USB joystick. The vehicle itself connects to the computer using a USB-serial interface. The entire system can be setup and ready to go in under five minutes. An on-board guidance system consisting of an inertial navigation unit and a magnetic compass provide heading, attitude and position data, as well as performing station-keeping functions, allowing effective operation in currents and low-visibility conditions. MIT ROV 5.0 can also carry several different types of sensors, such as temperature, pressure and salinity, not to mention a combination of infra-red and color cameras. Payloads currently being prototyped include precision deployment and recovery modules, a sample collection package, instrument bays and an articulated manipulator arm. This capability coupled with a production cost as low as $3,000 makes MIT ROV 5.0 an extremely valuable platform for exploration, research, education, environmental monitoring and small scale repair and recovery work. ©2007 MTS.",,1,0,Not relevant
,,E-learning in astronomy,cp,FernUniversität in Hagen,Hagen,Germany,"Lütticke, Rainer",Astronomische Nachrichten,Journal,"Since research in astronomy consists to a large part of work with a computer (e.g. control of telescopes, image processing systems, N-body simulations, calculations of models) it is evident that higher education in astronomy should also include e-learning, teaching and learning with the support of software. However, e-learning cannot only used for domains in astronomy in which computers are needed. The transfer of factual knowledge and exercises can also be effectively supported. E-learning in general has a lot of advantages which can lead to a higher quality of the learning process: place and time for learning is not fixed, there is no time- and cost-consuming travel to lectures or practical courses, speed of learning is not fixed, theoretical knowledge is transferred to practical knowledge by exercises, immediate automatical analysis of exercises is possible, experiences with software tools can be gained, and remote use of instruments is possible. In former times there was also the idea that e-learning could save expenses for instructors. However, this is wrong because in the e-learning process authors, tutors, and coaches are still needed. The above given definition of e-learning is very common (cf. Baumgartner 2003) and contains locally installed software on a computer (CBT = Computer Based Training) (e.g. CD-ROM or downloaded software from the Web), learning via Internet (Web-based learning), and learning using mobile or handheld technologies (mobile learning = M-learning). While M-learning is based on very new technologies and is up to now not used in astronomy there are a lot of applications for Web-based learning and CBT in astronomy. Thereby Web-based learning is more attractive for school and university students and therefore conducive to the learning process since possibilities for learning scenarios are larger (e.g. dynamic, interactive, and personalized applications, remote control of instruments, communication and cooperation with people at different places). E-Learning applications can be divided in five levels defined by the main actions of the learner (cf. Baumgartner 2003). At the first level learners read and receive using e.g. Web-sites or PDF-documents. Such e-learning applications contain only static information and the only use is the transfer of knowledge. At this level there exists a lot of e-learning material in astronomy. The main actions at the second level are using knowledge and exercising. Applications are standard tests (e.g. multiple choice, correlations, fill-in-the-blank) and drill & practice including programs for automatical correction of solutions. Such exercises for fields of astronomy are very common (e.g. course with WebCT: http://www2.oakland.edu/elis/WSO_demo.cfm). At the third level learners explore using simulations or animations. For astronomy there exists many interactive programs as applets containing applications in all fields of astronomy: from the solar system over star spectra and galaxies to cosmology (s. http://www.astro.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/luett/elearning.html). If learners have to decide and to select how a complex problem is solved the fourth level is reached. Solutions of such problems could be commands for an image processing system, natural language answers, or graphical solutions. These solutions can be corrected by a human tutor or a program (which can be very complicated and use methods of the artificial intelligence). An alternative is the presentation of the model solution without any correction. Such e-learning applications are very rare in astronomy and there is no application with an intelligent automatical analysis of complex solutions. Hands-On Universe (http://wwwlb.ph.tum.de) (although not constructed as e-learning application) gives some complex problems but without automatical analysis. At the last level learners research, develop and cooperate with other learners in virtual or remote labs, or CSCL (computer supported cooperative learning) environments using shared applications (e.g. Wiki, shared white-board), software tools, and connections between real instruments and Internet. There exist only very few of such e-learning applications. The MONET project (http://www.uni-sw.gwdg.de/~hessman/MONET/) gives access to robotic telescopes for school and university students via Internet and has therefore elements of this high e-learning level. The Sky Watch project has more elements of this high level (http://www.sky-watch.org). It includes for an European astronomical contest robotic telescopes, collaboration tools, and experts as online-coaches for self defined projects. Experiences show that students like e-learning at the level 3, 4, and 5. However, most applications in astronomy have the levels 1 and 2 because such applications are relatively easy to realize.",,0,0,Not relevant

Thanks to today's Internet technologies, students can access virtual labs for gaining and improving their spatial skills. Smith (1964) estimated that spatial ability plays a key role in at least 84 different fields, including medicine, dentistry, mathematics, chemistry, engineering, and computing and so on. This pervasiveness makes it important to create training methods that help people gain spatial skills needed to comprehend visualizations. In spite of the importance of spatial skills, it is usually costly to access spatial training facilities (e.g., physical robotics), especially for developing three-dimensional (3D) spatial skills. Internet technologies have made online learning an achievable goal in education (Balamuralithara and Woods, 2009). Virtual labs have vast advantages in becoming an alternative to physical labs. The virtual lab is one possible technique that makes it possible to share expensive equipment among several universities or education centers. In this research, we designed and implemented two different types of Internet-based training systems for students to gain and improve their 3D spatial skills in a virtual lab setting. One system is to give students a remote control through an Internet Application to manipulate an actual robot which performs object rotation and movement tasks in a professional lab, and the other system is a 3D computer simulation system, where students can conduct the same tasks as the ones through the remote robotic system.

This experiment, proposed by the joint team of both Italian universities, was selected, in the early 2009, by a panel of experts of the ESA (European Space Agency), DLR (German Aerospace Agency), SNSB (Swedish National Space Board) and SSC (Swedish Space Corporation) to fly on board the sounding rocket REXUS-7 in the framework of the REXUS/BEXUS Programme (Rocket and Balloon Experiments for University Students). The BUGS experiment has two main goals: the hands-on education and the deployment test, under microgravity conditions, of a boom for gravity gradient attitude stabilization of small satellites. The educational purpose consists on providing the university students with the opportunity of a practical experience in a real space project during their master and PhD courses, according to the educational philosophy of both laboratories of the universities of Bologna and Roma. The boom is based on an innovative design, exploiting rigidity properties of tape coiled springs. This new technology was never tested before in orbital conditions and REXUS-7/8 campaign provides the unique opportunity to analyse boom behaviour in microgravity conditions and to qualify it for space missions. This experiment aims to achieve data on boom vibration modal frequencies during the deployment phase in order to improve the numerical simulations accuracy of the satellite attitude dynamics. Demonstrating the suitability of this kind of boom for low cost missions is very useful, mainly for educational satellites, whose production had a large impulse in the last twenty years. The boom provides these satellites with nadir pointing attitude by mean of simple passive stabilization, permitting them to carry on a number of different experiments for Earth Observation.

,,Music in MATLAB: Programming challenges for an introductory course,cp,Indiana University Bloomington;Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne,Bloomington;Fort Wayne,United States;United States,"Moor, S. Scott","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"Students often find their first course that includes programming a difficult new world. First-year students may not be inspired by programs that input numbers, perform a calculation and then output a number. To help motivate students there are many examples of courses using robotics or graphics projects and problems to provide a more concrete result for programming exercises. MATLAB's ability to output a time series to the sound card of a PC provides an opportunity for problems that create sounds and music instead of numbers. This approach requires little or no equipment to implement. Over the past year and a half, we have developed problems and small projects for an introductory computer tools course where MATLAB is taught. Music and sound form the basis of challenges with a range of topics and difficulties. Problems have been developed that illustrate almost all aspects of the course from a script that plays a very simple tune to a general song player that reads a data file containing the note names, durations and amplitudes. This player illustrates the use of loops, conditionals and several sub-functions. Other project problems include functions to distort a .wav file illustrating file handling, a stereo player illustrating arrays, graphing a wave file illustrating graphing issues, adding harmony to illustrate array calculations, converting note names to frequencies illustrating the use of a switch structure or a complex calculation. More advanced projects can include adding attack and decay to notes, random generation of notes, developing a wind chime simulator and analysis of sound waves using a preprogrammed FFT function. Problems build over the course of the semester as students develop their ability with the software. In addition to developing students understanding of computer manipulations they are introduced to a range of important engineering topics including: waves, wave shape, sampling, digital representation of analogue phenomenon, sound, signal processing, analogue/digital conversion and bit resolution. These projects have added an interesting variation into the course. The students have found these projects challenging, and it has been important to develop aids to help them understand working with sound. Particularly important is providing materials to help students who have little or no musical training. This paper includes a discussion of the various problems and projects used and the lessons learned in implementing them. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.",,0,0,Not relevant

The global behaviour is achieved by defining a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated behaviours. We are interested in using evolutionary algorithms to develop appropriate control architectures. We observe that the layered arrangement of behaviours in subsumption architectures are a significant obstacle to automating the development of control systems. We propose an alternative subsumption architecture inspired by the bacterial metabolism, that is more amenable to evolutionary development, in which communities of simple reactive agents combine in a stochastic process to confer appropriate behaviour on the robot. We evaluate this approach by developing a traditional and a metabolic solution to a simple control problem using a simulation of the e-puck educational robot. Additionally we show that behavioural strategies designed into the metabolic controller can also be optimised through artificial evolution. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Control engineering | Evolutionary robotics | Metabolic modelling,2,0,Not relevant

However, the physical constraints of using radios in a robotic swarm are hardly obvious, and the intuitive models often used for describing such systems do not always capture them with adequate accuracy. In order to demonstrate this effectively in the classroom, certain tools can be used, including simulation and real robots. Most instructors currently focus on simulation, as it requires significantly less investment of time, money, and maintenance-but to really understand the differences between simulation and reality, it is also necessary to work with the real platforms from time to time. To our knowledge, our course may be the only one in the world where individual students are consistently afforded the opportunity to work with a networked multi-robot system on a tabletop. The e-Puck, a low-cost small-scale mobile robotic platform designed for educational use, allows us bringing real robotic hardware into the classroom in numbers sufficient to demonstrate and teach swarm-robotic concepts. We present here a custom module for local radio communication as a stackable extension board for the e-Puck, enabling information exchange between robots and also with any other IEEE 802.15.4-compatible devices. Transmission power can be modified in software to yield effective communication ranges as small as fifteen centimeters. This intentionally small range allows us to demonstrate interesting collective behavior based on local information and control in a limited amount of physical space, where ordinary radios would typically result in a completely connected network. Here we show the use of this module facilitating a collective decision among a group of 10 robots. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,60,0,Not relevant

We show how to deal with the interactions of the different elements of the devise used to taper standard optical fibers. We have analyzed all thus interactions between these elements and the robotic subsystems in order to achieve a modular design. The design methodology used for this purpose, includes tools for modeling the working environment like Google SketchUp and tools for CAD available to model the robotic subsystems like MLCAD. In this way, we can specify a set of modular mechanisms integrating the robotic manipulator for tapered optical fibers. We have performed tests of the built prototype in a mock up environment.

Teleoperation can also provide an instructor with an excellent motivating example for a control systems course where it can serve as a platform for introducing several key controls issues such as noise compensation and time delay. Computer packages such as Matlab and SIMULINK are readily available in most engineering schools for simulating teleoperation systems. In this article, SIMULINK is used to present a case study of a simple teleoperation system. Initially, a PI controller is introduced to control a simple bilateral teleoperator model without noise or time delay. It is then shown that the inclusion of time delay can significantly affect the system performance and can even cause the system to become unstable. A relatively new technique called the wave variable method is then used to stabilize the system for any fixed time delay.

We have defined, when possible, levels and grades of evidence, based on 2009 recommendations of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. We found that technological advancement and surgeon experience is a predictive factor for success or complications of URS. Experience may be related to special endourology training, time passed after basic training and the number of procedures performed. Studies suggest that a resident must perform a certain amount of cases to gain proficiency with URS, but there is still a need for well designed studies for the learning curve of URS to be accurately defined. Training models may be useful for training in URS and stone disintegration. Stone centres that provide all the endoscopic treatment options seem to provide the best conditions to ensure a sufficient volume of patients required.

The SEP robot simulator is a virtual reality (VR) simulator aiming to train users on the Da Vinci Surgical System. To determine the SEP's face validity, two questionnaires were constructed. First, a questionnaire was sent to users of the Da Vinci system (reference group) to determine a focused user-group opinion and their recommendations concerning VR-based training applications for robotic surgery. Next, clinical specialists were requested to complete a pre-tested face validity questionnaire after performing a suturing task on the SEP robot simulator. To determine the SEP's construct validity, outcome parameters of the suturing task were compared, for example, relative to participants' endoscopic experience. Correlations between endoscopic experience and outcome parameters of the performed suturing task were tested for significance.

At the end of the educational activities, subjects have tested the robot behaviour and presented a project report (a documentation on each phase of the work). Reports have showed the work strategies, the modalities of problem solution, as well as the cognitive strategies adopted by students in programming the robot. Regarding the laboratory devoted to the construction of Chua's circuits, its aim has been the dissemination of new science concepts among young students during the project ""Chaos at School: building a Chua's circuit, simulating its behaviour and using it to create sound and music"". The purpose of the project was to familiarize high school students with chaos and complexity related concepts, motivating them to build the physical circuit, simulate its behaviour and then to create patterns and music by software applications.

Paulo","2010 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics, RAM 2010",Conference Proceeding,"The benefits of robot simulation technology have been recognized by scientists and engineers, with applications ranging from simple robot path simulation to complete robotic cell layout simulation. Robot simulation is one of the essential elements of modern and agile manufacturing plants, as it allows to visualize and test a robotic system, even if it does not exist physically. High-growth industries and emerging manufacturing processes will increasingly depend on advanced robot technology such as robotic simulation. Robot path simulation is a very useful process to predict and pre-evaluate performance of robot programs generated off-line. This paper presents a simulation system where a relatively low cost and commercially available 3D CAD package is used as an interface to visualize/simulate pre-programmed robot paths. The developed system is intuitive and friendly, so that in a few minutes any user without knowledge of CAD and robot programming will be able to simulate robot paths and visualize it in a CAD environment. This way, this simulator can be useful for small and medium sized enterprises and for educational purposes. Three different experiments (simulation of robot motion/paths) are presented and discussed: a material handling task; a robot performing work in the footwear industry (shoes soles); and finally, the simulation of robot paths for a robot operating in a bending cell. The experimental results showed that the proposed system is flexible, easy to use and efficient. This paper also covers topics like how simulation makes robot programming easier, advantages and disadvantages of simulation in robotics, and the future trends in this field. Finally, the results of the experiments will be analyzed and discussed. The pros and cons of the system in relation to off-the-shelf robot simulation packages are analyzed. ©2010 IEEE.",CAD | Low cost | Robot | Simulation,12,0,Relevant

However, the implementation of e-learning in technical disciplines (e.g. Robotics and Simulation) is still far behind the rapid growth of practice in narrative disciplines (e.g. Database and Theory of Computer Science). The perception is that technical discipline education is inevitable in laboratory exercises, and increases the complexity of e-learning implementation. Information Technology (IT) experts', lecturers' and technicians' expertise combines to create interactive virtual learning for technical disciplines as well as a physical laboratory experience with real equipment. To prove the feasibility of the concept, Robotic decided to represent a technical discipline in Computer Science.

Lego Mindstorms' NXT Robots are fully integrated in the current Engineering Education stream to help students practically apply theoretical concepts. The courses Communication and Organizational Development (KOE) and Computer Science in Mechanical Engineering 1 (INFO1), provided by the interdisciplinary institute cluster IMA/ZLW, follow a newly-designed ""blended learning"" approach. This institute cluster is composed of the Institute of Information Management in Mechanical Engineering (IMA) and the Center for Learning and Knowledge Management (ZLW). These institutes are currently within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University. Two years ago, the course KOE was redesigned and redirected towards a ""Flipped Classroom"" concept by initiating online lectures and a discussion class. Thus, the tutorial class ROBOFLEX as part of the KOE curriculum is introduced. ROBOFLEX is a two-stage business simulation that enables students to experience realistic virtual communication within computer science and engineering disciplines. Students are divided into groups of about thirty people, and become entrepreneurs and founders of start-ups that specialize in the production of innovative robots for the automotive industry. They create these robots using Lego Mindstorms' NXT. Since its conception, the course INFO1 has been accompanied by a lab component, where students apply the concepts taught in class in a team-focused software design project. In 2011, the lab concept was changed into a two-stage robotics programming project based on Lego Mindstorms' NXT Robots and the Java programming language. In the first stage, students practice the fundamental programming concepts that are presented in the lecture by completing a series of exercises in a self-paced manner. The second stage focuses on applied problem-solving. In this stage, pairs of students apply the previously-learned programming concepts to program a ""pickand- place"" robot that is equipped with various sensors. The integration of Lego Mindstorms' NXT Robots into these courses also join the concepts of the two described courses. While KOE delivers organizational and communicational skills, INFO1 provides technical and domain-specific skills. Here, the robots represent the connecting element. The problem-based second stage of INFO1 benefits from the skills that are taught in KOE. Because INFO1 is scheduled in the term following the KOE, it offers a direct opportunity for students to transfer the KOE skill set from the lecture where it was taught into a new context that is primarily concerned with a different subject. Both classes have been evaluated and developed independently in the past. Since last year's introduction of ROBOFLEX in KOE, synergies between both lectures are becoming a main component of their further developments. In this paper the recent developments in both courses will be compared and discussed.

Finally, theembedding of databases into interactive work environments - forinstance, the use of databases in cooperative environments(computer supported cooperative work) - forces the databasecommunity to reconsider some of the traditional beliefs aboutdatabases. The Database Group at Hagen University has felt theseapplication pressures in various projects for quite a time. As aconsequence the emphasis of our research has shifted from databasecore technology to application oriented research. Where the formerresearch projects were mainly centered around concurrency control,recovery, distribution, and other “classical” database topics, thenew research projects are concerned with the support of designenvironments, where design includes all activities of developingcomplex artifacts and, in addition, usually involves thecooperation of a variety of people. Design here includes areas likemechanical CAD, software engineering, VLSI-design, multimediaproduction and many others. A characteristic of design in all theseareas is the use of a variety of heterogeneous tools which leads tocomplicated interoperability and integration issues. A key motivating factor in our work on design-environments isconcurrent engineering which certainly is one of today's majorindustrial challenges. For computer science it opens new problems,and at the same time it requires integration of different fields.The above mentioned new requirements for databases apply inprominent ways, including the issues of managing complex data,interoperability and integration, and support of teamwork. The second research area is distributed learning environments.We are working towards systems that in future will offer, in anintegrated way, computer based training and multimedia learningmaterial, access to all sorts of information bases, communicationfacilities, conferencing systems, and simulation, experimentationand exercising environments. Such systems are not only importantfor the changing needs of university education (first of allcontinuing education), but also for industrial education andtraining systems, especially in geographically decentralizedorganizations.

In recent years, many of these communities installed fiber optic networks to supply the required broadband. Consequently, trenchless solutions were sought to provide economical construction methods that diminish disturbance to the community. HDD and in-sewer fiber installations provide economical trenchless solutions. The in-sewer fiber technology uses robots in no-man entry gravity sewers and drains to install fiber optic networks. University campuses share the same above characteristics of downtowns and business districts. The universities need to transfer high volume of data for education, research and development, and administrative activities. It is imperative that every classroom, lab, office, and dorm on the university campus has a fast Internet connection. Also many universities are converting to distance learning (teaching classes via the Internet). Economical and efficient communication between the universities and research institutions amplifies the return on the limited funds allocated for research and development. This study evaluates the hypothesis that trenchless installation of the fiber optic network is more beneficial than open cut installation on university campuses. In the last five years, many universities installed their fiber optic network using the open cut technique, which has caused numerous inconveniences to their campuses. Bowling Green State University (BGSU) just completed the Supernet project where BGSU replaced its old copper backbone and main rings with fiber optics cables. The study uses the BGSU campus as a guide to simulate an average size campus. The simulated model was used to quantify and estimate the cost of the HDD, in-sewer fiber, and open cut solutions and to discuss the advantage and disadvantage of each solution.

The teams engage in an intense six-week effort to build a robot to do a specified task such as to scoop up a bunch of beach balls and put them into a large container. The robots are large and must operate both autonomously and with radio control. The contest itself has the atmosphere of a professional wrestling tournament, complete with a master of ceremonies and teams and cheerleaders in costume and often with painted faces and hair. All this has proven to be an effective draw for recruiting students to engineering and to a lesser extent to computer science. The College of Engineering and Computing at the University of South Carolina (USC) is sponsoring an unusual team composed of students from several high schools. Over time, and as interest grows to a sustainable level, the USC team will spin off teams to the participating high schools, further increasing the pool of students interested in science and technology. One recurring problem is that the robot software cannot be tested and debugged until after the mechanical and electrical subsystems are functional and nearly complete; hence, the programmers have minimal time, at the end of the development period, to work with the robot and they encounter great difficulty and frustration in developing and optimizing their code. Implementing the robot and the contest environment in a simulator such as Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio allows the students to develop their software and hardware concurrently.

The current methods to simulate on-earth the satellite attitude motion use robotics manipulators and spherical air bearings, which are complex, quite expensive and very delicate devices. This paper describes a small, low-cost and maintenance-free test-bed for agile satellite attitude control systems using momentum exchange devices. The test- bed consists of a small platform, equipped with momentum exchange devices, suspended on its center of mass by a sharp-tip element, providing a low friction contact needful to properly reproduce the on-orbit conditions. The suspension method assures continuous operation without any external energy sources, the absence of noise, a small footprint and a simple and quick installation. The overall apparatus weighs only a few kilograms and it is suitable to simulate the on-orbit behavior of an agile small satellite. The platform is equipped with a series of sensors providing attitude and angular velocity measurements, an electronic control board, a radio module and a battery pack. The control board reads the sensors data and use them to estimate the platform dynamical state, receives the command data from the radio module, performs the commanded maneuver, saves the dynamical state data and send them, thanks to the radio module, to the remote control computer. The suggested spacecraft attitude control system testing platform allows direct visual inspection of the momentum exchange among the on-board moving parts. This seems a useful tool not only for control systems engineers, but also for spacecraft operators, giving a direct feeling of the commands and maneuvers dynamical consequences. Hence the platform, being easily re-configurable, portable and maintenance-free, besides spacecraft specialists training, could be a valuable space outreach tool, with an educational value, providing an interesting and exciting way to high school and university students to deeply understand the rotational dynamics of rigid bodies. This paper shows the results of a series maneuvers performed with different configurations of the momentum exchange devices and the approach used to execute them, ultimately proving the suitability of this system to be a training instrument for the attitude guide, navigation and control of a small satellite.",,7,0,Not relevant

We expect to meet the requirements of distance learning by developing the software-based laboratory exercises, i.e., a virtual laboratory. To fully substitute a physical system like laboratory equipment, one must emulate its full dynamics. The mathematical model in the form of differential equations will be applied to calculate dynamics and provide the data that would otherwise be measured on a physical system - this means simulation. To prove the feasibility of the concept and make a step towards full e-learning in technical disciplines, we consider a complex technical field, Mechatronics and more precisely, Robotics being a perfect symbiosis of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. We present the Virtual Laboratory for Robotics (VLR). It possesses all the necessary features of a virtual laboratory: user interface, simulator, and visualization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Such simulations can be used for effective training of future operators of a given workplace and testing its ergonomic quality without need of building a physical prototype. The authors have devised several different approaches to preparation of virtual workplace prototypes for training. The basic approach is utilization of immersive VR systems (Head-Mounted Devices combined with user tracking solutions) to create an interactive simulation of a workplace, on the basis of its CAD model and specification of a realized process. The second approach is using a haptic manipulator with force feedback for interaction with a virtual workplace, for more realistic feeling of a realized activity. The third, novel approach is combination of the two previous approaches. A special system was designed and built for this purpose. It uses a large-space robot to allow haptic feedback for a user equipped with an immersive set of devices. More and more often virtual prototypes of the workplaces replace the physical ones as an innovative training solutions that allow to train the future operators or improve ergonomic quality of the workplace. The reason for that is the reduction of costs needed to develop the real prototype of the workstation as well as ability of complex virtual workplaces to change the variants in order to investigate different situations. Usually such workplaces - created as interactive Virtual Reality applications - consist of a visualization operated with aid of advanced Virtual Reality systems and devices. Implementation of an immersive equipment increases sense of user's presence and use of haptic devices with force feedback makes the experience more similar to reality. The level of realism is a very important factor in an immersive and haptic simulations of workstations for training purposes. As a form of instructional simulation, also called educational simulation, immersive and haptic simulations are a powerful learning tools that require trained users to complete tasks or to solve specific problems within VR environment that replicates the real workplace conditions19. Trainings conducted is this way are particularly beneficial when real activities and task conducted at the workplace is too dangerous, too costly or even almost impossible to do. The two basic approaches presented by the authors are innovative and important on their own, but they usually do not mix, as state-of-the-art haptic devices are stationary. Their application heavily limits spatial freedom of a user, which does not affect the level of realism of presented simulations in a positive way. In order to fully simulate the conditions of an assembly workplace, tactile input must be available, with simultaneous immersion of a user into a Virtual Environment (VE) using a HMD or a CAVE system combined with the user tracking solution. The third approach to simulation of workplace conditions, proposed by the authors, allows to bring a realistic force feedback into an immersive visualization.

Whilst this environment is the first 3D environment dedicated to interpreter-mediated communication, research in other educational contexts suggests that such environments can foster learning. The IVY 3D environment offers a range of virtual 'locations' (e.g. business meeting room, tourist office, doctor's surgery) which serve as backdrops for the practice of consecutive and dialogue interpreting in business and public service contexts. The locations are populated with relevant objects and with robot-avatars who act as speakers by presenting recorded monologues and bilingual dialogues. Students, represented by their own avatars, join them to practise interpreting. This article focuses on the development of the bilingual dialogues, which are at the heart of many interpreter-mediated business and public service encounters but which are notoriously difficult to obtain for educational purposes. Given that interpreter training institutions usually need to offer bilingual resources of comparable difficulty levels in many language combinations, ad hoc approaches to the creation of such materials are normally ruled out. The approach outlined here was therefore to start from available corpora of spoken language that were designed with pedagogical applications in mind. The article begins by explaining how the dialogues were created and then discusses the benefits and potential shortcomings of this approach in the context of interpreter education. The main points of discussion concern (1) the level of systematicity and authenticity that can be achieved with this corpus-based approach; and (2) the potential of a 3D virtual environment to increase this sense of authenticity and thus to enable students to experience the essence of dialogue interpreting in a simulated environment.",Authenticity | Corpus-based approach | Dialogue creation | Dialogue interpreting | Virtual environment,16,0,Not relevant

Contrarily to research activities, the use of the ROBOTRAN symbolic models are exploited in such project, more for an educational motivation than for the computer efficiency of the simulation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,7,0,Not relevant

The robots could arrange themselves on walls or ceiling of a room and make words or sentences or symbols with different or same colors. This kind of interactive teaching is especially helpful for kids. They could also be used for the actions like spreading on the ceiling making it looks like a sky full of stars or making an event viewer or reminder. The robot formation problems have never been studied for educational purpose before. The assembling and making of those characters as well as other interactive formations mentioned here are not available in the literature. The robots considered here are mini robots with volume of almost seven cubic centimeters with minimal burden of communication and having the capabilities of wall climbing. We are not available with these robots in our lab so we tested and verified our algorithm on simulation. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.,Autonomous robots formations | Intelligent robots | Mobile robots,0,0,Not relevant

Mateo Sanguino, Tomás;Márquez, José Manuel Andújar",Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Robotics and Applications,Conference Proceeding,"The present work describes a set of virtual instruments (VIs) useful to study and to evaluate surface and volume trajectories applied to anthropomorphic robotic arms. The trajectories technique used is a straight-forward and easy to follow method which allows simulating the motion of serial manipulators with up to 5 degrees of freedom (DOF). The interest of this method is that its algorithms allow making the trajectory planning by means of a web user environment. These VIs are part of 3D Robotic Arm Simulator (3D-RAS) devoted to the kinematics evaluation and remote control of robotics arms. They help, in a visual manner, to develop teaching/learning aspects in robotics practices. The aim is visualizing and studying the behavior of anthropomorphic robotic arms prior to a real control. As a practical case of the VIs developed herein, an educational and research project is presented: Laboratory for E-learning with Robots (LER), which led to teaching in Automatics, it is being carried out by teachers and students at the University of Huelva (Spain).",Engineering education | Kinematics | Robotic arm | Trajectory planning | Virtual laboratory,0,0,Not relevant

This work focuses on the development of a new educational simulation tool for the ""Robotics"" subject in the third year of the ""Computer Engineering"" and ""Electronic Engineering"" degrees at the University of Huelva (Spain). The developed tool (3D Robotic Arm Simulator, 3D-RAS) is aimed at engineering practices and demands students no programming knowledge. Its highly graphic interface allows easy and simple definition of both parameters and geometry in serial arms with up to five degrees of freedom (DOF). Therefore, this work focuses on an innovative graphic environment designed for teaching professionals which allows them studying D-H conventions, mapping both forward and joint workspaces, evaluating surface and volume trajectories applied to anthropomorphic robotic arms, and visual observation of the movement of serial robotic manipulators.

,,"Modelling and control of a small quadrotor for testing propulsive planetary landing guidance, navigation and control",cp,Politecnico di Torino,Turin,Italy,"Canuto, Enrico;Perez-Montenegro, Carlos","Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",Conference Proceeding,"The problem of on-ground testing guidance, navigation and control (GNC) algorithms for planetary accurate and safe landing can be approached through the Flight of small quadrotors (< I kg mass), suitable for indoor and outdoor operations. This way was undertook for instance by the STEPS project funded by Regione Piemonte, Italy, and is under development. The literature is full of studies and experiments with such aerial vehicles (sometimes referred to as aerial robots as well) aiming at very different exploration, commercial and education goals. Here we focus on the test of GNC algorithms for planetary landing that are partly presented in a companion paper submitted to this conference and others submitted elsewhere (1). Only simulated results will be presented as a baseline, as the relevant hardware, to be employed outside of the aforementioned project STEPS, is under procurement. Modelling and control design will follow the Embedded Model Control methodology (2). Firstly, the main difference of an on- Earth-flying quadrotor dynamics with respect to a generic planetary landing vehicle is analyzed, showing that a similitude can be formulated, capable of scaling down mass, geometry and trajectories to outdoor tests, and of compensating the different gravity acceleration. As a result, indoor tests look rather critical as they would require small quantization to quadrotor thrusts, in order to keep landing flight duration constant. Similitude to be very accurate needs a careful model of propeller dynamics and response. A further problem comes from emulating radar altimeter and velocimeter; both can be emulated by a GPS receiver but reliably only in outdoor tests. Indoor tests should require camera. Radar altimeters are massive. Altimeter may be also emulated by a barometric altimeter. Ultrasonic range sensors are used at touch-down. Initial alignment must be provided by some attitude sensor either magnetometers or external markers, or the accelerometer themselves (on-ground). Subsequently under a short flight time (< 200s), attitude, velocity and position can be obtained by gyro and accelerometer integration. Thus essential sensor devices are assumed, namely LMU (accelerometers and gyros) and ultrasonic range sensor (conservative conditions). An outline of the guidance, navigation and control algorithms is included. Simulated runs are provided. Copyright© (2012) by the International Astronautical Federation.",,2,0,Not relevant

The market does tend to get larger and variety driven and there is a choice for almost any given price, however, the price / size ratio seems to remain constant. Larger scale manipulators do not show the price amortization enjoyed by the majority of the computerized consumer hardware over the past few years. In addition, the manufacturers for many of these manipulators do not provide adequate pre-sales supporting technical material (whether a result of lack of standardized specifications or pure negligence), nor effective warranties and service. Primarily affected are higher level educational institutions, where manipulators arc likely to be exposed to student projects that demand constant diversity, various controlling software and hardware technique; they are likely to become victims of abusive usage and in addition to these, the institutions need to offer some of the highest standards of safety for the students. This paper presents a flavor of a software simulation and control package applied on a specific manipulator that is a significant tool in solving problems such as the above mentioned ones.

Interac-tive simulations have conquered all areas of applications like acquisition, training, or research. Anecdotal observa-tions on human-in-the-loop simulations have shown a sig-nificant difference in actor behavior between simulations and the actual application. The factors which make simula-tion so attractive, namely the absence of constraints and especially of imminent danger for persons and equipment, seem to influence the behavior and thereby the performance of the user. The concept of perceiving a simulation as 'real' and of 'being in' the simulation is called 'sense of pres-ence'. It is hypothesized that the application type will affect the perceived sense of presence and will thereby lead to performance differences. The aim of this research is the relationship of presence and performance in real and simu-lated teleoperation tasks. In teleoperation related training, education, and research, the robot is often replaced by a simulation while keeping the real control elements. Based on the hypothesis that the user behaves and thereby per-forms differently in simulations, these differences could jeopardize the generalization of such VE-based results.

To address these shortcomings, the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Department at Miami University introduced MATLAB as an alternative Window-based interface language to better reflect the current educational experience of students and to increase the functionality of the RV-M1 robotic arms. MATLAB successfully overcomes the limitations of the QBASIC/DOS environment and augments the capability of the RV-M1.

Several projects aimed at hands-on education are developed by the SRL including: an observatory for observation and monitoring of space debris and the creation of payloads for sounding rockets and stratospheric balloons, that are part of the ESA education program; together with the realization of the Cubesat depicted in the paper. Cubesat is a cube-shaped nano-satellite with the side of 100 mm. Despite its small size, it has a system for attitude control, a telecommunication system, a camera and a power system. Considering the size and requirements of the various systems, the organization of interior spaces was one of the major issues in the design of the structure for which it was necessary to identify innovative solutions. The Cubesat structure was realized by polymer (ABS - Acrylonitrile - Butadiene - Styrene) with the technique of ""rapid prototyping"" thanks to equipment provided by the V-Lab of the II Faculty of Engineering of University of Bologna. The Rapid Prototyping technique has several advantages including the quick implementation and low cost. Moreover, for the construction of a small satellite it is very useful the ability to succeed in details, sometimes difficult to achieve with the use of tools machine except with a significant increase in costs. Another important advantage is the ability to use a material with a lower density than the commonly used aluminum alloy. The structure must be able to resist at the stresses due to the launch vibrational and static loads. For this several simulations using a FEM code have been performed during the design phase, moreover a Test-Pod system in aluminum alloy was built and used to perform vibration tests for the qualification to launch with Indian PLSV launcher of the Cubesat prototype.

Complex scenarios required that instructors read aloud from written scripts to describe the patient's changing conditions, forcing the learners to contribute a significant amount of imagination. Where adequate simulators did not exist, students would be taught by first observing one or several procedures, followed by performing the procedure on a patient under supervision, and eventually on their own. Emergency procedures were learned in this apprenticeship manner. The integration of part-task trainers and full-body high-fidelity robotic patient simulators into clinical education has dramatically changed medical educators' ability to suspend disbelief and utilize preprogrammed scenarios to achieve standardization and complexities that were not previously possible. Utilizing this approach for training allows them to minimize the risks to patients, challenging the limitations of the traditional ""see one, do one, teach one"" axiom.

This paper addresses the goal of revolutionizing student education using collaborative gaming and competition, both in virtual simulation environments and on real hardware in space. The concept is demonstrated using the SPHERES Zero Robotics (ZR) Program which is a robotics programming competition. The robots are miniature satellites called SPHERES - an experimental test bed developed by the MIT SSL on the International Space Station (ISS) to test navigation, formation flight and control algorithms in microgravity. The participants compete to win a technically challenging game by programming their strategies into the SPHERES satellites, completely from a web browser. The programs are demonstrated in simulation, on ground hardware and then in a final competition when an astronaut runs the student software aboard the ISS. ZR had a pilot event in 2009 with 10 High School (HS) students, a nationwide pilot tournament in 2010 with over 200 HS students from 19 US states, a summer tournament in 2010 with ∼150 middle school students and an open-registration tournament in 2011 with over 1000 HS students from USA and Europe. The influence of collaboration was investigated by (1) building new web infrastructure and an Integrated Development Environment where intensive inter-participant collaboration is possible, (2) designing and programming a game to solve a relevant formation flight problem, collaborative in nature - and (3) structuring a tournament such that inter-team collaboration is mandated. This paper introduces the ZR web tools, assesses the educational value delivered by the program using space and games and evaluates the utility of collaborative gaming within this framework. There were three types of collaborations as variables - within matches (to achieve game objectives), inter-team alliances and unstructured communication on online forums. Simulation competition scores, website usage statistics and post-competition surveys are used to evaluate educational impact and the effect of collaboration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel index of total torque is proposed by considering the posture of the supporting legs. The new index can be used to optimize the leg's structure and operation for consuming minimum power and avoiding unstable postures of the robot. A characterization of the proposed six-legged robot is obtained by a parametric analysis of robot performance through simulation using the presented dynamic model.

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced benefits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry. By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, a NAO humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been configured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models. Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children's use of the novel system. Children aged 6-8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with.

You can design spaces for standardized patient encounters, task-trainer skills development, or full-body robotic patient simulator scenarios. Typically, for in-hospital care teachings, the latter are staged in rooms that look like the real environments that the simulated events are expected to occur in: the labor and delivery suite, operating rooms, emergency rooms, intensive care units, and patient recovery wards. The very presence of any heterogeneous structure inhabited by diverse users both generates and constrains the latter's relationships with, and utility from, the structure. Mindful use of structure-function relationships allows your simulation center to become a living entity that provides the optimal learning environment while being adaptable to a variety of learner-educator experiences and needs. Structure-function relationships are not intuitively obvious. It is more than the position of the walls, doors, and windows in your simulation space. You need to establish meaningful linkages in your simulation center between the basic scientific principles and clinical practice while being cognizant of what are the educationally important questions.

The described MoSART Environment is shown to be useful for analyzing, designing, visualizing, and evaluating control systems for a broad class of dynamical systems which include: a collection of pendulum/robotic systems, aircraft, helicopters, and other six degree-of-freedom systems. The environment - referred to as Control3D-Lab l - is based on Microsoft Windows, Visual C++, Direct-3D, and MATLAB/Simulink2. The environment can be used as a stand-alone application or together with MATLAB, Simulink, and toolboxes. When used as a standalone application, a friendly graphical user interface permits easy interaction. Users may select (via pull-down menus): systems, dynamical models, control laws, exogenous signals (including joystick inputs) and associated parameters, initial conditions, integration routines and associated parameters. When used with MATLAB, Simulink, and toolboxes,the above nominal features are significantly enhanced. In either case, the interface permits users to access the following (via pulldown menus): animation models, mesh properties, texture and lighting models, system-specific visual indicators, graphics to be displayed, animation/data display/storage rates, simulation control buttons, and extensive documentation. When Simulink is present, users can exploit extensive visualization and 3D animation features through provided and/or user-generated Simulink diagrams. This capability makes the developed environment very extensible with respect to mathematical models and control laws. Additionally, users may readily export simulation data to MATLAB/toolboxes for post-processing and further analysis. The environment also contains a suite of well documented (easy-to-modify) models and control laws that are implemented within the provided Simulink block diagrams. Provided (special) blocks enable animation, joystick inputs, and (near) real-time simulation and animation (when possible)3. Associated with each block diagram are system-specific, menuaccessed m-files that permit detailed analysis and design. A hardware module permits real-time control of actual hardware experiments. The developed environment is shown to be a valuable tool for enhancing both controls education in a variety of classes as well as research. Examples are presented to illustrate the utility of the environment. © 2006 IEEE.",,2,0,Not relevant

In fully implementing the Timed Default cc framework, jcc supports the notion of (typed) logical variables (called ""promises"", after [5]), allows the programmer to add his/her own constraint system (an implementation of the Herbrand constraint system is provided), implements (instantaneous) defaults via backtracking, implements a complete renewal of the constraint-store at each time instant, and implements bounded-time execution of the Timed cc control constructs. jcc implements the notion of reactive vats [5] as single threads of execution within the JVM; a vat may be thought of as encapsulating a single synchronous, reactive Timed cc computation. A computation typically consists of a dynamically changing collection of interacting vats (some of which could potentially be located at different JVMs), with dynamically changing connectivity. jcc programs fully inter-operate with JAVA programs, and compile into standard JVM byte-code. jcc programs fully respect the JAVA type system; logical variables are typed. jcc is compatible with the Generic Java [3] extensions, thereby allowing the use of parameterized types. Indeed, jcc may be viewed as an extension of JAVA which replaces JAVA'S notoriously difficult imperative thread-based concurrency with the notion of reactive vats interacting via constraints on logical variables. jcc source code is available under the Lesser GNU licence through SourceForge. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,9,0,Not relevant

Research methods used to study program impact included statistical analysis of pre- and post- tests, qualitative research techniques of eliciting information using subject-produced drawings, journal writing, focus groups, and observation. This project is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Information Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program aimed at enhancing traditionally underrepresented youths' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects. Disciplinary experts were drawn from materials science, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, sustainability, science education, mathematics education, cognitive psychology, counseling, and education research methods. These experts worked with K-12 educators to design and deliver an extra-curricular middle school engineering education program. The program utilized the engineering design process as the fundamental construct for engagement with the novel teaching and learning experiences. The program provided experiences where participants learned engineering and information technology skills through activities such as simulating desert tortoise behaviors, and researching and developing designs to mitigate the urban heat island. They also participated in leadership development activities over the summer serving as docents for younger children at the local science center, a research internship with the university, and an industry internship with a local energy and water service provider. Student learning was assessed using formal and informal methods. Informal assessments consisted of whiteboard presentations, open-ended questioning, demonstrations, journal write-ups, and teacher observations. These were used to guide daily activities and lessons. Formal assessments consisted of pre and post assessments. Subject produced drawings were used to elicit students' pre- and post-program knowledge. Draw a Robot and Draw an Engineer assessments were used. A survey instrument was developed and implemented to elicit tinkering and technical self-efficacy. An earlier developed instrument that was validated using a sample of responses of 200 engineers to develop the items was modified for use with youth. Observations of project activities by external evaluators, interviews with educators, school administrators, program facilitators, principal investigators, industry volunteers, collaborators, and student participants, were used to study whether project and research goals were met. Pre and post assessments in the form of open-ended questions related to content in major units were administered. Assessments were analyzed to determine what impact the project had on student learning and student interests in related STEM content. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on each unit to compare differences in the relationship between pre and post assessment scores. Data revealed that by engaging youth in learning experiences that emphasizes both utilitarian and inquiry-based motivations, where learning is made relevant to students' lives, the outcome leads to enhanced learning in content areas. We have also learned that systematic efforts are needed to dispel misunderstandings regarding STEM subjects and professions. Coordinated and carefully designed in-depth and long-term experiences are needed to provide students and families with knowledge of STEM education and career pathways. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.",,2,0,Not relevant

The medical gestures were analyzed in terms of ultrasound probe attitude and used in the definition of the kinematics specifications of the proposed manipulator. The Spherical Parallel Mechanism is selected because its characteristics meet the constraint requirements. The optimal synthesis of spherical parallel manipulators is performed using a realcoded Genetic Algorithm based method. Simulations on the actuator responses of the structure allowed us the validate it. In order to control this robot, we have also designed a haptic device that provides easiness to use as well as force feedback. Its orientation control strategy is based on a use of an adaptative kalman filter which efficiency was demonstrated during experimentations. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",adaptative kalman filter | genetic algorithm | motion capture | spherical parallel mechanism | tele-echography,8,0,Not relevant

The goal of the project was to expose undergraduate electrical engineering students as early in the curriculum as possible to the challenges presented by real projects. The project had to be relatively long term, multidisciplinary, and it had to require both technical depth and breadth, problem solving skills, ethical responsibilities, communication skills, effective teamwork and planning skills. The basic idea was to engage students in an activity that would emulate as closely as possible the industrial environment they will be facing soon after graduation providing students with the opportunity to gain the skills and tools needed in the day-to-day practice of engineering. Toward this end, in collaboration with the biology department, a group of undergraduate electrical engineering students were challenged with the task of building a robotic arm for the artificial insemination of endangered amphibian species. The rationale was to maximize the fertilization success rate by using an artificial insemination process resembling the natural process as closely as possible. From the very beginning students were encouraged to work on the project independently and with as little supervision as possible. They were also asked to be in charge of all phases that characterize the design and development of a typical engineering system including system specification, project planning and management, feasibility analysis, system simulation and performance assessment, prototyping, verification and validation of the system functionality and its constraints requirements, system implementation and finally the documentation of the end product.

,,New approach to teach product design that breaks the disciplinary boundaries,cp,New York City College of Technology,New York,United States,"Heng, Iem;Zhang, Andy S.;Zia, Farrukh","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"This paper presents an initiative and a strategy to teach product design to students in different engineering technology fields through cross departmental collaboration and cooperation between faculty members in the Mechanical Engineering Technology and the Computer Engineering Technology Departments. The work is funded by the National Science Foundation Advanced Technology Education Division (Award No. DUE-1003712) recently awarded to New York City College of Technology. Traditional approach to teach product design in a college setting was mostly confined by disciplinary boundaries. There were very little or no collaborations among various engineering departments. Advances in computer technology and semiconductor electronics have created a new product design field called mechatronics. Mechatronics treats product design as system design that requires the tight integration of mechanical components, electrical/electronic systems, industrial design ideas, computer-control systems, embedded systems, and intelligent software into the product design and development processes. Most of the products now being developed are mechatronics in nature. To help students to understand the multidisciplinary nature of the product design, various hands-on product design projects have been developed by the faculty members in the two engineering departments. Students from four different fields of the two departments (mechanical engineering technology, industrial design technology, electromechanical engineering technology and computer engineering technology) have been involved in these projects. Students are divided into design teams. Each design team consists of students from different fields. Joint class sessions are being held and taught by faculties from the two departments at different stages of the design project. Students started to gain important experience in team work, time management, and collaboration and cooperation through various design activities. This concurrent engineering and mechatronic design approach, which emphasizes team collaboration, has become the new industry standard in product design and development. Students were given specific mechatronic/robotic design projects that required them to use actual mechanical, electrical/electronic hardware and software that are being currently used by the industry. This enable the instructor to simulate actual product design activities occurred in the industry. Not only were students exposed to the latest mechatronic technology, they also learn the concurrent engineering design approach in the process. Students were provided with a framework of fundamental design knowledge with hands-on cross-disciplinary activities that allow them to develop an interdisciplinary understanding and integrated approach to product design.

The main idea and contribution is to introduce students to Second Life (a free 3D social virtual world) and to the Linden Scripting Language (the Second Life programming language with a syntax similar to C) and then to ask them to design robotic avatars replicating low and medium complexity behaviors which they have previously seen or programmed for simulated or real robots. This approach brings flexibility in working time and a definite social dimension which add to the benefits of the traditional classroom education. Results from a survey conducted with students taking a Robotics and Virtual Reality course demonstrate the validity of this approach in stimulating the students in learning. © 2014 IEEE.,avatars | Robot control | simulation | virtual reality,1,0,Not relevant

,,Introduction of mechatronic technology into cross-department product design curricula,cp,New York City College of Technology,New York,United States,"Zhang, Andy S.;Heng, Iem;Berri, Sidi;Zia, Farrukh","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"This paper presents the work that is currently conducted by faculty in the departments of mechanical engineering technology and computer engineering technology to introduce mechatronic technology into product design curricula of both departments. This work is funded by the NSF ATE (National Science Foundation Advanced Technology Education), Award No. DUE-1003712 recently awarded to New York City College of Technology. Advances in computer technology and semiconductor electronics have created a new product design field called mechatronics. Mechatronics treats product design as system design that requires the tight integration of mechanical components, electrical/electronic systems, industrial design ideas, computer-control systems, embedded systems, and intelligent software into the product design and development processes. It requires engineers, technicians, and designers from various disciplines to possess broader knowledge beyond their specialized fields and to work together concurrently. This concurrent engineering and mechatronic design approach, which emphasizes team collaboration, has become the new industry standard in product design and development. Mechatronic technology has been identified as one of the top 10 highly influential emerging technologies of the 21st century by MIT's Technology Review and by the International Center for Leadership in Education. Students from both departments were given mechatronic/robotic design projects that required them to use actual mechanical, electrical/electronic hardware and software that are currently being used by the industry. This enabled the instructor to simulate real life product design activities inside the classroom and laboratory. Not only were students exposed to the latest in mechatronics, they also learned the concurrent engineering design approach. Students were given a framework of fundamental design knowledge with hands-on cross-disciplinary activities that allow them to develop an interdisciplinary understanding and integrated approach to product design. Through these hands-on activities, students will also learn the concept of product lifecycle management and sharpen their teamwork skills. Curriculums of the all three programs (mechanical engineering technology, electro-mechanical engineering technology, and industrial design technology) will be modified to create crossdepartmental design projects. Students will learn how to design, construct, evaluate, operate, and test mechatronic products. Activities include: 3D design and modeling, materials and manufacturing process selection, mechanical and structural design, electrical/electronic design, computer control with embedded systems, interfacing, programming, and project management. These simulated product design activities will give students a better understanding of product design processes and provide them with much needed hands-on experience. Students who enroll in this training program will serve as student mentors to help local high school students to engage in various pre-engineering activities such as FIRST Robotic Competition (FRC) and FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).

Mechanical Engineering Technology, B.S. Computer Engineering Technology and B. S. Technology/Manufacturing curriculum. Industry today desperately needs skilled engineers and manufacturing professionals that can modernize and improve manufacturing processes and product designs for manufacturability to be able to compete in the ""global economy"" of today. Therefore automation skills need to be introduced to the student in all three of the above degree programs. The author's describes how his industrial experience helped him shape an interdisciplinary course that challenges the student to be creative and build on the strengths of his/her fellow students in four degree fields. The student of today needs to be more ""Job Ready"" and not just ""know the theory"" if he/she is to compete for the jobs of tomorrow. This includes being able to work in interdisciplinary groups to accomplish project goals. The use of self directed laboratory experiences can keep the students engaged and active in learning the course objectives. The use of laboratory teams made up of the different degree programs more closely simulates the reality of autonomous interdisciplinary design teams in industry today. The paper will relate how the course has become one that the students not only come willingly to formal lab hours, but insist on having expanded access to make their project come to life. Employers today are also looking for employees that can accomplish smaller automation projects without having to hire a consultant that leaves as soon as the start button is pushed. The paper will relate examples of industrial alliances and how students have stated that the experience in the classroom has translated to the student being more ""Job Ready"" and actually receiving job offers due to these laboratory experiences.

At engineering laboratories in which practices with robotic arms are necessary for understanding fundamental concepts of theory, students need to accomplish a complete study attending to different aspects related with kinematics. Its graphic user interface (GUI) is a straight-forward and easy-to-follow Denavit-Hartenberg (DH)-based method which helps at engineering practices without requiring a programming knowledge. We develop, in a theoretical way, both forward (FK) and inverse kinematics (IK), which are necessary to demonstrate the study of an educational robotic arm as a practical case. The interactive simulation tool allows defining DH parameters and geometry in serial arms with up to 5 degrees of freedom (DOF). Thus, the interest of this work lies in an innovative graphic environment which teaching professionals can use to study DH convention, observe the movement of serial robotic manipulators and map both forward and joint workspaces in a visual manner. This process is much simpler that interpreting the results in an analytic way. Furthermore, the generic capabilities of this simulation tool allow comparing different robot arm configurations (considering its physical parameters and mechanical characteristics previously known), both if robotic arms are physically available or not in lab. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In particular, the mathematical modelling and simulation of a microprocessors (chips) manipulator robot in electronic board assembling line is presented. The modelling problem is treated using two different approaches: the classical approach using Newton's equations and the energetic approach using Lagrange's equations. The final expressions obtained from these two approaches are compared as well as the development of the models. Regarding the final expressions, some differences were found in the models. Regarding the development of the model, it was found that the Lagrangian approach is simpler than the Newtonian approach. This is due to the fact that the Lagrangian approach does not require deep knowledge of kinematics and kinetics of rigid bodies, and also because it manipulates scalar equations which are easier to work with than the vectorial equations obtained from Newtonian mechanics. With the simulation, the response of the position of the manipulator in presence of different inputs (forces and torques) is studied, being the results of both models practically the same. As real system data was not available, the validation of the models was done as follows: a matrix from minimum-time- positioning curves for each manipulator body (link) was obtained, generating acceleration, velocity and position values for each time instant of the path. Then, introducing these values into the respective differential equations, the necessary forces and torques values to make the manipulator tip describe the required path were calculated. Finally, these values were introduced as inputs in the simulation, generating the same values of the kinematics variables stated initially as outputs.",Lagrange's approach | Modelling | Newton's approach | Robotics | Simulation,0,0,Not relevant

The objective of this setup is twofold, on one hand it aims to be a useful educational tool for teaching robotics and on the other it is a tool to help in the development and study of embodied evolution. The design represents an intermediate system between a real and a simulated scenario so as to work with real robots and to make easier and simpler the configuration and modification of the rest of the elements of the experiments. The present operational setup consists, mainly, of a video projector to represent the virtual elements projecting them over the arena of the experiment, a zenithal camera to capture the state of real elements moving on the arena, and a computer which monitors and controls the scenario. As a result, both real and virtual elements interact on the arena and their state is updated based on world rules of the experiment and on the state and actions of other elements. The scheme implemented in the main computer to control and structure this environment is based on the one proposed in a previous work for the definition of scenarios in a simulation environment named Waspbed, which was designed for the study of simulated coevolution processes in multiagent systems. Apart from the advantages provided in robotics research when large testing period times are required, this setup is used for getting students from engineering degrees used to deal with robotics and all its associated fields, such as artificial vision, evolutionary robotics, communication protocols, etc. in a very simple, quick and cheap way, which otherwise wouldn't be feasible taking into account the academic constraints of time and resources. © 2011 IEEE.",autonomous robotics | educational robotics | embodied evolution | Learning environments | multirobots system | virtual environments,1,0,Not relevant

,,Synchronized robots: A PID control project with the LEGO mindstorm NXT,cp,University of Oklahoma,Norman,United States,"Davis, Chad Eric;Mai, Anh","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",Conference Proceeding,"Typical courses in introduction to controls are usually heavy in theory and light in practical application. In order to emphasize practical application in this type of course, such as the implementation of a PID controller, there are problems with most of the commonly used options. The first option is to provide the students with an approximate model of a system and have them use simulation to implement a PID controller. The simulation approach is limited because there is not an ""actual system"" to control and the model is likely oversimplified. A second option requires the instructor to create a control system that all students use. This approach is expensive, time consuming, and not all students have access to the system at the same time. A third possibility requires students to build their own system and then control it. The problem with this approach is that so much time is dedicated to mechanical and electrical design, while important control theory concepts are left out or deemphasized. A solution to these problems is providing the students with a LEGO Mindstorm NXT kit, which allows them to quickly design their system so they can focus on the application of control theory. These kits are inexpensive and can be used for other functions such as freshman orientation courses and outreach events when not being used for controls. In the Introduction to Control Systems Engineering course (ECE 4413) at the University of Oklahoma (OU), students were given a LEGO Mindstorm NXT kit and some brief training in the LabVIEW programming environment in order to complete a class project. The students implemented PID control algorithms to produce synchronized robots that tracked each other's movement. Implementing PID control in LabVIEW without any built-in PID functions allows students to discover how the control algorithm works in a visual way. With this method, the likelihood of retaining the knowledge would appear to be much greater than modifying a built-in function while doing simulations. This paper will show how this project increased the students' understanding of PID control. Pre-project and post-project quizzes are used to provide statistical evidence of improvement. Students' perceived value of the project is also explored. Additionally, details of the project are provided so that other universities looking to emphasize practical application in their introductory controls course can replicate it. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.",,3,0,Not relevant

Mental imagery may be considered a multimodal biological simulation that activates the same, or very similar, sensorial and motor modalities that are activated when we interact with the environment in real time. Neuro-psychological studies show that neural mechanisms underlying real-time visual perception and mental visualization are the same when a task is mentally recalled. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms involved in the active elaboration of mental images might be different from those involved in passive elaborations. The enhancement of this active and creative imagery is the aim of most psychological and educational processes, although, more empirical effort is needed in order to understand the mechanisms and the role of active mental imagery in human cognition.

We have four PCs, one for each hexapod (so each hexapod has a helping brain). The PCs are inter-connected using the parallel port. We can assign a task for the team, for instance to explore a field. The PCs must work coordinated, exchanging messages. The development of this experimental scenario has been the subject of several projects, done by students involved in robotics and computer science. One of the aspects covered is the use of real-time operating systems, for the PCs to work together. Other aspects are related with mobile robotics and behaviors of insectoids. The general set-up has been completed recently, and a new project will start, to accomplish a task and study the results. An object-oriented simulation is also another new project, which will be validated against the experimental results. Every project must generate documentation, for others to use it. In general, the idea is to establish an interesting challenge, with obvious results.

Instead of studying real human/animal behavior, we study autonomous behavior of mobile agents that have virtual sensors to “see” the world and move around with virtual “wheels.” The autonomous behavior is synthesized by the agent's internal dynamics, which evolve using a genetic algorithm. A purpose of synthetic psychology is to create a new concept in order to understand an essential psychological phenomenon. Therefore, the simulation framework has to use models sufficiently simple to analyze the behavior, but sufficiently complex to provide a theory to understand the psychological experiments. As an example of synthetic psychology, we describe a simulation study of turn-taking using coupled dynamical recognizers. Studying turn-taking phenomena in robot experiments (e.g. Brooks et al., 1999; Dautenhahn, 1999; Steels and Kaplan, 2001; Miyake et al., in press) stresses the importance of embodiment and situatedness. In particular, MIT AI Lab's well-designed face robot, Kismet (Kismet project, 2000), can make use of human social protocols to stimulate natural emotions and social responses in humans. Even conversational turn-taking is established with a human subject. To do this, Kismet relies on subtle cues of human expression and interaction dynamics.

Our results are negative: test scores were lower in the robotics sections than in the nonrobotics ones, nor did the use of robots have any measurable effect on students’ choice of discipline. We believe the most significant factor that accounts for this is the lack of a simulator for our robotics programming system. Students in robotics sections must run and debug their programs on robots during assigned lab times, and are therefore deprived of both reflective time and the rapid compile-run-debug cycle outside of class that is an important part of the learning process.

The present study provides the first systematic review of all the trails of the various VR robotic platforms.

The MEDLINE ®, EMBASE® and PsycINFO® databases were systematically searched until September 2011. References from retrieved articles were reviewed to broaden the search. The simulator name, training tasks, participant level, training duration and evaluation scoring were extracted from each study. We also extracted data on feasibility, validity, cost-effectiveness, reliability and educational impact. We identified 19 studies investigating simulation options in robotic surgery. There are five different robotic surgery simulation platforms available on the market. In all, 11 studies sought opinion and compared performance between two different groups; 'expert' and 'novice'. Experts ranged in experience from 21-2200 robotic cases. The novice groups consisted of participants with no prior experience on a robotic platform and were often medical students or junior doctors. The Mimic dV-Trainer®, ProMIS®, SimSurgery Educational Platform® (SEP) and Intuitive systems have shown face, content and construct validity. The Robotic Surgical SimulatorTM system has only been face and content validated. All of the simulators except SEP have shown educational impact. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of simulation systems was not evaluated in any trial. Virtual reality simulators were shown to be effective training tools for junior trainees. Simulation training holds the greatest potential to be used as an adjunct to traditional training methods to equip the next generation of robotic surgeons with the skills required to operate safely. However, current simulation models have only been validated in small studies. There is no evidence to suggest one type of simulator provides more effective training than any other.

And virtual reality has a great potential to revolutionize several aspects of medicine and surgery, such as medical education and surgical training, telemedicine and telesurgery. With the development of nanotechnology and microelectromechanical system, the surgical instrument and robotic system can be made as small as 1 or 2 mm for they can be inserted through small vessel and can be navigated through vessels for diagnosis and treatment of disease. Laparoscopic surgery is a transition technology that marked the beginning of the information age revolution for surgery. Telepresence surgery, robotics, tele-education, and telementoring are the next step in the revolution. Using computer-aided systems such as robotics and image-guided surgery, the next generation of surgical systems will be more sophisticated and will permit surgeons to perform surgical procedures beyond the current limitations of human performance, especially at the microscale or on moving organs. More fundamentally, there will be an increased reliance on 3-dimensional images of the patient, gathered by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, or other scanning techniques, to integrate the entire spectrum of surgical care from diagnosis to preoperative planning to intraoperative navigation to education through simulation. By working through the computer-generated image, first with preoperative planning and then during telepresence or image-guided procedures, new approaches to surgery will be discovered. These technologies are complemented by new educational opportunities, such as tele-education, surgical simulation, and a Web-based curriculum. Telementoring will permit further extension of the educational process directly into the operating room. Robotics are now being used in all surgical fields. By increasing intra-abdominal articulation while operating through small incision, robotics are increasingly being used for a large number of visceral and solid organ operations, including surgery on the gallbladder, esophagus, stomach, intestines, colon, and rectum, as well as for the endocrine organs.

This common introductory robotics course generally covers the fundamental theory of robotics including robot kinematics, dynamics, differential movements, trajectory planning and basic computer vision algorithms commonly used in the field of robotics. The nature of this material almost necessitates the use of robotic hardware to allow the students to practice implementing the theory they learn in class.

This includes the use of inverse kinematic equations used to determine the joint inputs based on the desired location of the end-effector, as well as trajectory planning and the study of differential movements.

The miniaturization trend will support the improvement of CubeSats' capabilities, and will suggest the opportunity - as already attained in case of larger spacecraft - to have in orbit servicing for these smaller platforms. This paper intends to focus on the robotics related to these in-orbit servicing operations, that strongly differ from larger-scale, Canadarm-like operations typical of the Space Shuttle or ISS. The relative velocity associated with an orbital rendezvous, as well as the performance of the joint motors, do not scale together with the dimensions, so that collision risks and maneuvering should be carefully assessed differently with respect to ""standard"" space proximity operations. To this aim, the paper presents extensive simulations of the capture phase. The reference to a specific, even if experimental design for the spaceplane allows to understand the special requirements for the system's mechanics, and to extract issues and considerations that apply in general to all servicing operations involving small orbiting platforms. A major result from the analysis is that the capture manoeuvre does not affect in a significant way the attitude of the chaser, so mat relevant hardware should not be considered a design driver for the mission. Furthermore, the range of values for the torques required from the motors are computed, providing useful indication for the actual design of the robotic arm.",,0,0,Not relevant
